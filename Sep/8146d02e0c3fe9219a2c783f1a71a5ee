The lack of power is a big problem in Togo and Benin, two small countries in West Africa. Rural access to electricity in both countries is about 16% and the level of poverty is high. Without substantial infrastructure, they import more than 80% of their electricity from neighbouring countries like Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire and Nigeria. But that dependence could be coming to an end.

The Beninese and Togolese environmental agencies conducted a joint environmental and social impact study in 2014 that they submitted to the Dutch Commission for Environmental Assessment (CNEE), which specialises in environmental studies of dam projects.         The CNEE found that the dam project would lead to the loss of agricultural land. It added that the project would cause young people to leave the area as well as a deficit in agricultural products that could fuel inflation in local markets. The CNEE also noted that the project would increase the likelihood of water-related diseases. The CNEE found that the dam project would lead to the loss of agricultural land.
