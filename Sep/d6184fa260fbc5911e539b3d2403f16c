The chokka industry has dwindled in recent years, partly due to over-fishing and climate change. Regulations have been implemented to try and save the chokka population around Port Elizabeth. Before these new regulations the chokka fishing industry traditionally only closed for five weeks in October and November. New regulations implemented by the SA Squid Management Industrial Association (Sasmia) now closes fishing for April, May and June. This has left thousands of fishers with no source of income during this period. The chokka industry has dwindled in recent years, partly due to over-fishing and climate change.

To supply a typical small chokka vessel for the 21 days at sea about 3,000 litres of diesel is needed at a cost of R38,000. Together with food and all the other supplies necessary for the crew and trip, the total cost is over R60,000.

The 14m Santo Mersch has been a home to skipper Roy Westerdale for the past 32 years. Westerdale has two families, his family at home and his crew on the boat. Both look up at him to make the right decisions, and both depend on him for safety. His crew and family rely on him to find the chokka. He has missed many family milestones – birthdays, the festive seasons, graduations and anniversaries. 13 December 2016 was the first time he was home for his wedding anniversary – their 30th.

Themba Ngazitha, a 51-year-old from Humansdorp, has been working on chokka boats for over 20 years, supporting his wife and daughter, Patricia. His daughter has three children of her own, which he also provides for financially. The number of people that rely on him has caused him a great deal of stress.
