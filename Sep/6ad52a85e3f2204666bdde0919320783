The National Freedom Party (NFP) was a force in northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) politics but did not contest the elections in eNdumeni in 2016. One has to factor in the 2014 provincial results to determine what kind of impact they could have on the ward to get a better indication of how things could play out yesterday. It turns out that the NFP came a distant third here in 2014. What was most telling of the 2014 results is that the ANC easily won the voting districts here, winning the areas which make up Ward 3 by over 1,900 votes. In 2016, the IFP won the ward by over 660 votes. It was a remarkable swing to the IFP. The fluctuations in support for both the IFP and the ANC meant that despite the ANC only garnering 34% of the vote here in 2016, it was the dominant player here in 2014 and there was an opportunity for another wild swing in this ward.

The IFP will now hope that they can govern properly in eNdumeni and rely on the outside support of the EFF. The DA will be happy with the fact that the ward in Dawid Kruiper is even more competitive now. It was a disappointing night for all the other parties, with the EFF getting some encouragement from the result in Nkomazi.
