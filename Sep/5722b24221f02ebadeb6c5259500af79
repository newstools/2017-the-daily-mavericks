       On a blustery spring morning in Cape Town, what was once a disused industrial area next to the V&A Waterfront sang with life. The occasion: the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Zeitz Mocaa (pronounced “zights mocka”), an art museum promising to be to Cape Town what the Tate is to London, or the Met is to New York. On a blustery spring morning in Cape Town, what was once a disused industrial area next to the V&A Waterfront sang with life. The occasion: the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Zeitz Mocaa (pronounced “zights mocka”), an art museum promising to be to Cape Town what the Tate is to London, or the Met is to New York.        Speakers at the event competed to produce ever-more hyperbolic metaphors to describe the significance of the day. “You are amongst the first to witness the writing of a new chapter in South Africa’s history,” V&A Waterfront board chair Elias Masilela told the assembled crowd.

At a cost of more than R500-million, borne by the V& A Waterfront corporation – and by extension its investors, the currently besieged Public Investment Corporation – the silo has become what is certain to be one of the most photographed edifices on the African continent.

Heatherwick said at the opening that he deliberately did not want the building’s impact to be carried in its external frame, out of fear that people would arrive to take a selfie before it and then leave. Indeed, the magic of its interior is hard to predict from its exterior, dominated by the protruding “flies’ eyes” windows which actually belong to the luxury hotel seated atop the museum.

Step inside, however, and the hype is well-founded. Heatherwick has carved a breathtaking cathedral from an industrial storehouse he describes as being originally “filled with pigeon poo in quantities I’ve never seen before in my life”. Out of – in Heatherwick’s words – an “extraordinary, weird space made of tubes”, the British architect has created a soaring space which gives grandiose life to an equally towering ambition.

But by definition, South African artists can only provide a portion of the works on offer in a museum aiming to capture the zeitgeist (Zeitzgeist?) of an entire continent’s creative output. Other must-sees include Zimbabwean Kudzanai Chiurai’s provocative protest art and Swati artist Nandipha Mntambo’s reckoning with questions of gender and postcolonial identity. The museum feels vast and absorbing, mixing permanent exhibits with temporary installations; one could easily spend half a day there, or more.

Critics may also say that the museum is designed with the Instagram generation in mind, with an emphasis on forms like photography and fashion. But the Zeitz Mocaa team has made no bones about the fact that accessibility is a priority. This is not your granny’s art museum; by definition, its ambit is restricted to “contemporary” art and it is interpreting that brief quite literally.

Much of the criticism of the Zeitz Mocaa project up till now has seemed fairly vague and ill-defined. That it is “elitist”; that it too closely mirrors similar museums in the West; that it has not “engaged closely” with local artists and galleries.

It is hard not to feel that some of this comes down to parochialism, envy and snobbery – around a takkie salesman (Zeitz) having the audacity to present himself as an artistic taste-maker, and a glorified shopping centre (the V&A Waterfront) positioning itself as a home of fine art.

At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Masilela called it like it is when he described the Zeitz Mocaa as “a museum in the heart of commerce”. Masilela clearly found nothing problematic in that description, but others will feel differently.

Placing an African art museum in the heart of what is now the most expensive real estate on the continent may seem to some to be fundamentally at odds with what such a museum should signify. But the reality is that the Zeitz Mocaa is a corporate project – which is what has enabled its development on such an impressive scale. The Waterfront owns the building, and paid for its renovation. Corporate sponsors include Bloomberg, BMW and Standard Bank.

But under-18s get in free daily, and every Wednesday any locals – and anyone producing an African passport – is also granted free entry. For a private initiative – rather than a government-funded one – it is hard to see what more could be done to ensure accessibility while also covering running costs. It should be noted that even a state museum like the South African National Gallery charges an entry fee, albeit at a fraction of the Zeitz Mocaa price.

Other criticism levelled at the museum has included that white men (and foreigners) have been over-represented in the project’s construction and direction, giving it a whiff of neo-imperialism. Director Mark Coetzee has explained that all of the museum’s curatorial staff get a vote in exhibition decisions, however, and 25 curators will receive subsidised training at the museum annually.

It’s too early to tell how much weight these concerns should be given. It’s been pointed out that there is a possible conflict of interests in the fact that Coetzee is in charge of acquisitions both for the museum and for Jochen Zeitz’s personal collection, meaning that he may have an incentive to display certain works to raise their value for Zeitz. Coetzee has indicated that the terms of the museum’s agreement with the Waterfront mean that there is no obligation for the museum to display a particular number of Zeitz’s works, but it will remain to be seen how this works in practice.
