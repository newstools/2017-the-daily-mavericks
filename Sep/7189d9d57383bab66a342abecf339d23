It is governed by its own legislation, the Government Employees Pension Law, to manage and administer pensions and other benefits for government employees in South Africa. It has more than 1.2-million active members and in excess of 400,000 pensioners and beneficiaries. Its asset base, made up of investments in shares, bonds and other funds, is reportedly worth more than R1.7-trillion. A defined benefit fund means that government pensioners can expect at least a known and fixed monthly pension pegged against inflation irrespective of the performance of the underlying assets.

On this measure, the GEPF is still underfunded. To put it in non-financial terms, the GEPF looks okay provided nothing goes wrong.

They are like suretyships. They represent an underlying obligation to step in should the actual creditor guaranteed by the state be unable to pay the debt.

Perhaps its board needs to be selected like other Chapter 9 institutions who in turn appoint management against criteria focusing on proven skills.
