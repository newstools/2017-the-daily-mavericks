What is the place of ubuntu in such an endeavour?        When people refer to the word “ubuntu” in South Africa, it is generally intended to be understood as having an obvious meaning and to counsel what is good, and desirable for building constructive relationships between human beings. Often it is seen as a specifically African concept. (See: Magobe Ramose. African Philosophy through ubuntu Rev ed Mond Books Harare, 2002 and J Broodryk’s Ubuntu: Management Philosophy Knowledge Resources Publishing Pretoria, 2006.)

The word connotes “humanness”, deriving from proverbs meaning that one person realises himself or herself through relationships with others. Ubuntu is a proverb – which is found in many African languages in South Africa. Umntu ngumntu ngabantu/ motho ke motho ke bantu – “a person is a person because of others”.

Until an individual is incorporated into this or that community, individuals are considered to be entities to whom the description “person” does not fully apply. Personhood is something that is achieved. It is not simply given because one is born of human seed. In the long process of becoming a person, the community plays a vital role as catalyst and in prescribing norms. (Ramose, pp. 65-66.).

The term ubuntu has considerable currency in South African discourse. On the one hand, it is widely used by religious and political leaders, to embrace a broad respect which human beings are encouraged to have towards one another. Embracing ubuntu as a way of living is often seen as something that can hold South Africans together and become a basis for “social cohesion” and common nationhood.

In some respects ubuntu has become commercialised, being used, as is the case with certain other words and phrases as the name of business enterprises. (cf for example Ubuntu Armed Response, Ubuntu Financial Services, Ubuntu Catering, Ubuntu bikes.) These companies know the salience that the words have for many South Africans but they are adopted not because the enterprise is at all related to the concept, but purely for profit making. Ubuntu is also advanced as a “management philosophy” to raise productivity, as in Broodryk’s work, mentioned above.

Although ubuntu is found in proverbs in isiXhosa, isiZulu and other Nguni and Sotho languages, it also has equivalents in other South African languages and languages of other African countries, for example, in various versions of Shona. (Michael Gelfand, The genuine Shona: survival values of an African culture, Gwelo. Mambo Press, 1973.) It is sometimes claimed that similar words are found in countries throughout the continent.

At the same time, there is resistance in some quarters to the idea that this word has non-African equivalents, such as “fraternity” or “humanism” (Ramose, 2002.) Broodryk, who is described as “the first person to obtain a doctoral degree on the philosophy of Ubuntu” (cover of his book), is very definite about the “African” and “philosophical” character of ubuntu. He writes: “Ubuntu should not be confused with the general philosophy of Western Humanism. Ubuntu as humanness is African” (at p 1).

Insofar as ubuntu is widely diffused in South African discourse there needs to be debate – if ubuntu is to contribute towards constructive social interactions in this country.        The basic words of the proverbs from which ubuntu derives seem – essentially – to enjoin human beings to relate to one another in a manner that is in line with the notion of community, (as indicated by the first quotation from Ramose, above). A community is essentially about joining people together on a range of potential bases. Ubuntu is in its literal meaning about realising oneself through the Other, counselling individuals against selfish, inconsiderate practices and to relate constructively to one another because that is the basis for well-being of each person.

We need to engage with the various ways in which ubuntu is being used. It is often seen as an unchanging element of African culture and also a quality that inheres in all African people. (Ramose, 2002.) But it is important in initiating debate that we try to establish meanings, in the plural, that are given to ubuntu, where it is in use, given that African people live in some cases in conditions similar to that under which the proverb originally emerged, but also many or most are now in quite different situations. To what extent and how is the concept used in these new conditions? Is it possible to develop a common meaning or a synthesis which is at the same time emancipatory, inclusive, community-oriented and respectful of all the peoples of South Africa? The answer to that question ought to derive from debate. We need to engage with the various ways in which ubuntu is being used.

Insofar as ubuntu derives from proverbs in Nguni languages and equivalents in seSotho and other languages, there are also proverbs in these languages that counsel behaviour that is contrary to that of ubuntu, or in their divergence point to complementary features of social interactions.

The significance of the existence of proverbs counselling other forms of behaviour is that it indicates that contesting visions are found in proverbs.
