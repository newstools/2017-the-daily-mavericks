In the context of fighting State Capture, big business has for too long been impotent, whether voluntarily or forcibly through the over-sized influence of government in our economy. It now has a golden opportunity to play a role in the reconstruction of South Africa’s moral fibre. A chance to do something beyond giving employees time off to join anti-corruption marches.

The UK-based firm has seen its local partnership involved in questionable engagements time and again. From this we can only assume that they absorbed more than just employees and clients of Arthur Andersen, whose flippant disregard for ethics ended in that company’s demise; if they weren’t already present and welcomed to a cosy new home, that is.

What KPMG did is far, far worse than Arthur Andersen’s role in Enron. In that case, the potential liability from onerous American laws caused the collapse of the auditing firm which had turned a blind eye to some creative accounting. In South Africa, we do not have that kind of legislation hanging over KPMG’s head so we need those oft-too-quiet voices of business leaders to step in and show some moral leadership in dealing with KPMG.

Corporate Mea Culpas, in this country at least, rarely happen and if they do, hardly come with any meaningful consequences. And this could have been one of those cases. Trevor Hoole was hoping this was going to be the case when 18 months ago we published the first article highlighting KPMG’s bogus findings of the investigation into the SARS Rogue Unit in exchange for R23-million and 139 pages of sometimes copied-and-pasted content.

The majority of employees will be snapped up by rival firms as they scramble to service the extra workload, while second-tier and local firms will benefit from the bump in business.
