After a series of negative media reports and two letters from McKinsey declaring concerns over Trillian’s ownership, Singh and head of capital Prish Govender, proposed a termination of the contract that included a settlement payment to McKinsey and Trillian. Termination of the contract was proposed to the Eskom board tender committee as an effort to save face and money.
