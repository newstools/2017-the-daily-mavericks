       Speaking on Tuesday before the federation’s march against corruption on Wednesday, Cosatu General-Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali described what he viewed as the system behind the current crisis of state capture: capitalism. “The government’s neoliberal policies have weakened the state and allowed the private sector to be in charge of policy formulation,” he said.

Despite their leaders taking prominent positions, both Cosatu and the SACP’s relevance within the alliance has continued to decline.

They talk left while the ANC repeatedly walks right, with President Jacob Zuma failing to heed their advice.

Cosatu and the SACP have for years been trying to have a stronger influence within the alliance, without success. The labour federation has made gains in labour laws protecting workers, but both partners have a declining influence on broader policy and are ignored when it comes to key decisions.

Rival federation the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) and independent mining union the Association of Mineworkers Union have dismissed the march as a farce. Neither Amcu nor Saftu will join the demonstration. Saftu General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, who was expelled from Cosatu, said the federation’s current leaders had failed to acknowledge their role in supporting Zuma and state capture, while they also purged opponents from their unions.

Unisa’s Professor Dirk Kotzé said the march could not be expected to have a direct influence on challenging corruption, but it could build pressure after recent public demonstrations against the president and revelations contained in the #GuptaLeaks. But, with the ANC election race so dominant in the alliance, he said, “State capture itself is somewhat lost in the process.” Unisa’s Professor Dirk Kotzé said the march could not be expected to have a direct influence on challenging corruption, but it could build pressure after recent public demonstrations against the president and revelations contained in the #GuptaLeaks.

It has been part of the ANC. It has not really challenged the ANC.” He said Cosatu is compromised as its leaders have taken direction from the ANC and the trade union federation remains weakened after it expelled its biggest affiliate, Numsa.

There are very few leaders within the alliance who are not compromised in one way or another. Cosatu’s march, however, symbolises a key moment in the future of the alliance. Cosatu and the SACP have called for Zuma to resign and have barred him from speaking at their events. The relationship has deteriorated to the extent that they can’t even hold joint meetings. Both Cosatu and the SACP are calling for a “reconfiguration of the alliance”. They want to play a stronger role after they were slighted by former President Thabo Mbeki and Zuma, particularly in his second term.

Kotzé said he didn’t see any road map towards reconfiguring the alliance, regardless of who wins in December. He said the ANC’s liberation model, the national democratic revolution, was based on it leading the alliance. “Now to claim that all of them are equal obviously conflicts with that model that many in the ANC are used to.” Kotzé said he didn’t see any road map towards reconfiguring the alliance, regardless of who wins in December.

The alliance partners played a key role in electing Zuma in Polokwane in 2007, but they failed to win the influence they were seeking. Even if their increased activism helps Ramaphosa get elected, they might continue to be side-lined unless they are able to negotiate greater powers.

But unless they can break the alliance mould they’ve willingly participated in, their efforts will come to naught. If they don’t further acknowledge their role in factionalism and state capture, they shouldn’t even bother trying.
