When Johnson Sirleaf took office in 2006 at age 67, she exhorted Liberians to roll up their sleeves and join her in the task of post-war reconstruction. She prioritised four areas – peace and security; economic revitalisation and consolidation; governance and the rule of law; and infrastructural renovation. These have become the yardsticks by which her presidency has been judged.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was negotiated into the 2003 Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement as a cornerstone of the national reconciliation process.

It recommended an additional 50 – including Johnson Sirleaf – be barred from public office for 30 years for supporting various warring factions.

To establish Liberia’s current tenuous peace, Johnson Sirleaf chose stability over accountability, advocating for restorative over retributive justice.
