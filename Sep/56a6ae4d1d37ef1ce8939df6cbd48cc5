It is not easy to write the story of someone who has never previously trusted the public with her narrative. It is even less easy when that person dies in the course of the book being written. It gives yet another dimension of tragedy to Kuzwayo’s story that she would pass away from AIDS-related complications just months before the book was completed.

Tlhabi writes that Kuzwayo had intended to approach the book’s publication as a kind of rebirth into public life. She was ready to attend book launches with Tlhabi, and to be named and acknowledged fully in public in a way that she had rejected since the trial and its terrible aftermath. But it was not to be.

Tlhabi is no hagiographer. Khwezi does not glorify Kuzwayo, or make a martyr or hero of her. Tlhabi writes candidly of a woman who could be maddeningly flighty, unsure of what she wanted and prone to squandering opportunities. Kuzwayo comes across as by turns exuberant and troubled; often depressed but capable of easy joy. The Fezekile in Tlhabi’s pages is garrulous and funny; an over-sharer, but hard to pin down; impulsive and a poor planner. “One fool at a time” is her wry catch-phrase. She is complicated, and human.

Kuzwayo’s father, Judson Kuwazyo, was an ANC comrade of almost equivalent stature to his close friend Jacob Zuma. Like Zuma, he was from KwaZulu-Natal. Like Zuma, he was sentenced to a 10-year jail term on Robben Island – at the same time as Zuma. Such was his influence that Kuzwayo had an MK unit named after him – which Zuma would go on to lead. Kuzwayo served as the ANC’s chief representative in Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. When he died, Tlhabi notes, President Robert Mugabe sent a personal note to Oliver Tambo to express his regret.

Yet today Judson Kuzwayo is virtually unknown, outside of those with long memories intimately connected to Struggle circles. Partly that is attributable to his early death in a car accident in 1985, aged 43. But it is equally a reflection of how only certain comrades have prospered and been lionised in post-apartheid South Africa. Both Fezekile and her mother, Beauty, expressed some bitterness to Tlhabi about the way in which the families left behind were treated in the Struggle.

Kuzwayo once told Tlhabi she thought her life would have been easier if it had been her mother who died in exile, rather than her father. “My family died fighting for this freedom and the movement does not really care about widows and orphans,” Kuzwayo said. When Kuzwayo died, funds had to be scraped together from well-wishers to pay for her funeral. Tlhabi records that her mother still lives in poverty.

Judson Kuzwayo’s early death allowed his daughter to cling to an idealised version of the man throughout his life – though she once speculated in her diary that he might have turned out like “the other uncles”.

For any woman to go through the ordeal Kuzwayo had to endure on the stand and emerge still possessing the will to live is testament to her strength of character.
