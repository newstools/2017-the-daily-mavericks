At that time, the key role players were still alive, such as the investigating officer General Stoffel Buys (described by the Timol lawyers as “thoroughly corrupt”), and the two primary interrogators, Captain Johannes van Niekerk and Captain Johannes Gloy. Timol apparently committed suicide moments after these two stepped out of the room, allegedly leaving him under the control of pay clerk, Rodrigues. The matter was handed to Macadam to investigate.

Macadam testified that he was not aware of any approach made to the national director, but that he was approached by Cajee himself, who informed him that the daughter of Rodrigues had gone to a journalist by the name of Ivor Powell with her father’s confession to her of how Timol was murdered. “I immediately reported the allegations to the DSO (‘The Scorpions’),” wrote Macadam. “A chief investigating officer was sent to interview Mr Powell and establish whether Sergeant Rodrigues could be charged with murder. I was informed that after the investigation no basis for the allegations could be established.

Shortly thereafter, he continued, he was taken off all TRC cases and assigned to a lengthy prosecution involving an “international nuclear weapons syndicate”. When he was later instructed to return to the TRC cases, he went on, he looked into the Timol matter—in 2015, according to Macadam’s affidavit, he formally requested the NPA to open an investigation.
