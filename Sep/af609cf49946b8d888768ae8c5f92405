At the same time, we must acknowledge that every caricature is founded in fact. We are well aware that business is not blameless and we are cleaning our house first and foremost. You will have seen the robust position we have taken on KPMG which engaged in unethical and unprofessional conduct completely at odds with BLSA’s values. The firm became party to the project of “state capture” which has harmed our country, victimised individuals and damaged the reputation of business. And we have called for an independent investigation and full disclosure on the part of KPMG. At the same time, we must acknowledge that every caricature is founded in fact.
