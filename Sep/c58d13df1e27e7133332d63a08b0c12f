       Manuela Gray began her life drawing. She started on walls, furniture, and anything she could get her hands on. She ended up tattooing, eventually opening Cape Town’s legendary Wildfire Tattoos. Pop culture factoid: a highlight was tattooing Queen’s Roger Taylor. Ink on skin seemed to choose her, she says.

The three snakes I stitched across these further engage with Milton’s epic poem, using imagery prevalent in the art of The Number.
