The new volunteers will be working in communities across Limpopo and Venda. “ I took a weird route because I studied business and after my studies working in the business sector was a horrible experience, so I decided to volunteer for Peace Corps because I felt more content in servicing and helping other people,” said Alex Riviere, a new volunteer from New Jersey.

Even though the Peace Corps has been in South Africa for more than 20 years, it is still developing its identity. “The most important thing is to work with the government, to provide resources and assistance for those in need. In five years from now I hope that we are still involved in education but not in the same way that we are now. Now we are focused on Grades 4 to 7. I am hoping that we will go to the lower grades so that we can help them,” said J Ronald Campbell the US Peace Corps country director.
