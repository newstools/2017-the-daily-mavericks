Such chest-thumping rhetoric is actually pretty usual in these speeches. Why, after all, would a national leader stand in front of the whole world and then choose to rail about his or her nation’s inherent deficiencies? While Trump’s language choices and his Queens, New York City-style bray can grate upon his listeners’ ears, all of that can be discounted rather easily. That’s just style, Trumpian style.

But much more troubling, of course, were Donald Trump’s flights of bombast directed specifically towards North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. There were no substantive comments about any errant behaviour by Russia in Ukraine. Its current massive military exercise in Belarus is reportedly using as much as 10 times as many troops as international agreements allow. (Any exercises involving more than 12,000 personnel must allow for military observers from Nato). Nor was there comment on Russia’s deep, troubling involvement in the US 2016 election.

This list from Donald Trump of countries to be knocked around was actually a pretty predictable roster of international bad boys, from the perspective of the US. It is, after all, a rare American (and, increasingly anybody else) who will rise up and defend Maduro’s Venezuela and its mendacious, self-destructive economic policies, or its increasing slide into a harsh and increasingly despotic left-wing authoritarianism.

While most Americans are repelled by Cuban authoritarianism, by the same token, a clear majority of the nation (including Cuban-Americans and the US business community) have come to the conclusion that a US-Cuban relationship rapprochement is appropriate, timely, and useful. The Trumpian rant against Cuba seems to be – at its heart – something of a domestic play to keep his core supporters feeling he still has their back. Or something. It still seems unlikely he will roll back the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations, despite muttered threats.

But then we get to North Korea and Iran – special objects of fury in the Trumpian universe.

But the real heart of his complaint is Iran’s reported support for groups like Hezbollah in Syria and Gaza – issues that do not figure in the P5+1 agreement.

But Trump was just as scathing about the idea of an international common good. Instead, Trump’s measure of international progress, success, and appropriateness was his strong endorsement of “America First”, now translated into the pre-eminence of national sovereignty universally, and thus a reaffirmation of the Westphalian world that came into being post-1648. This position by Trump was in contrast to any appreciation for the possibilities and potential successes of global co-operation and the retreat of individual sovereignties by the world’s nearly 200 nation states.

Inevitably, however, the rhetorical overdrive that pervaded his speech will be what is truly remembered; that, and the parodies of Elton John’s song lyrics of Rocket Man that are now threatening to overwhelm the social media space.
