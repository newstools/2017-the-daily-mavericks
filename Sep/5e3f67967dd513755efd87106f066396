Daily Maverick has reliably learnt that Cabinet, which traditionally gives the nod before crime statistics are released, has not done so yet. It is understood the crime statistics for the 2016/17 annual year were taken to Cabinet on Wednesday, but were not discussed. The next opportunity for this would be at Cabinet’s next regular meeting in two weeks.  However, the SAPS annual report may not feature the annual crime statistics.

If the annual crime statistics – a key indicator of SAPS performance in its constitutional responsibilities to ensure safety and security – are not part of the SAPS annual report, it would be a first in democratic South Africa, except for 2000 when then safety and security minister Steve Tshwete had imposed a moratorium on crime statistics.

Although Cabinet last year decided the SAPS crime numbers should be released every three months to Parliament’s police committee, due to the need for Cabinet endorsement the police have presented quarterly statistics that were up to six months behind time, as they did in May this year, much to MPs’ chagrin. And the committee repeatedly questioned the methodology of compiling these statistics as it often amounted to comparing apples and oranges.

One explanation government may fall back on, even if it is a narrow approach, would be to argue that the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), which governs annual reports, does not expressly stipulate that the yearly crime statistics must feature included in the SAPS annual report. According to the Act, aside from the forewords by a minister and accounting officer – the director-general or in the case of the SAPS, the national police commissioner – reporting areas include audited financial statements, human resource information, details on disciplinary matters and the like. But a failure to include crime statistics in the SAPS annual report would make parliamentary oversight and public scrutiny more difficult.

On Monday the police committee is scheduled to start its oversight considerations of the SAPS annual report alongside those of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) and Civilian Secretariat, which are also signed off by minister Fikile Mbalula as their political head. Said police committee chairperson Francois Beukman: “The committee will process the annual reports. We will be ready on Monday.” He declined to speculate on whether crime statistics would be included as this was part of the ministerial mandate.

The issue of crime statistics has been a fraught one for years. There have been questions about the methodology of collecting and collating statistics, based as they are on reported cases. Further questions have been raised about how up to date they are. Inclusion in the annual report that covers the previous financial year effectively meant they are between 12 to 18 months old by the time they are released in September the following financial year.

Yet the SAPS for years has concentrated on what it calls trio crimes – house robbery, business robbery and hijackings.
