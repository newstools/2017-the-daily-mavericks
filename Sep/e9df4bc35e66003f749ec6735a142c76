Before her death, Makeke was working as an activist with the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). She was not the only activist that had faced gender-based violence. Eventually, says TAC co-founder Zackie Achmat, after years of struggle – low conviction rates, drawn-out cases, dockets going missing – the organisation’s anguish boiled over at a failing justice system. TAC, Equal Education and the SJC mobilised men in particular to picket where the justice system failed victims of gender-based violence.

When we decided on a commission of inquiry, we wanted it to be a comprehensive one that looks at safety and the criminal justice system,” Achmat explains. “This had been preceded by probably hundreds of marches and pickets. We had hit a brick wall. The critical thing was to break open that brick wall and to get to understand the problem – what was wrong with the SAPS and what was wrong in terms of infrastructure development and inequality, and how the two link.”  When we decided on a commission of inquiry, we wanted it to be a comprehensive one that looks at safety and the criminal justice system,” Achmat explains. “This had been preceded by probably hundreds of marches and pickets.

In a recent statement, the SJC described it as follows: “The Commission itself was a truly ground-breaking moment. For the first time in South Africa many of the inner workings of the police were made public as tens of thousands of pages of SAPS information was made available. It offered the opportunity for residents to tell their stories and senior officers had to account to the public.”  TAC, EE and SJC were instrumental in the fight in court for the Commission of Inquiry.

According to local government, business is booming for B&Bs in Khayelitsha. Airbnb announced at a recent press launch that it would be grabbing a slice of the pie. Earlier in September, GroundUp reported that the area would soon be releasing its own gin.  Khayelitsha is growing – not just in numbers, but in terms of its footprint.

But headlines running alongside tell a different story: an abalone bust worth R6-million; citizens marchers protesting "Enough is enough" after the murder of Zanele Sandlana; calls to mobilise against continued violence against women; a call for street lights to reduce crime; a Khayelitsha man trying to rob an officer of his firearm.

In August 2017, the office of the Western Cape Premier said “steady progress” was being made in implementing the recommendations made by the Khayelitsha Commission, which was headed by Constitutional Court Judge Kate O'Regan and Advocate Vusi Pikoli. The premier’s office said feedback from the task team and “various stakeholders involved” suggested “a marked difference in the working relationship of participants in the safety space in Khayelitsha – a significant change in the right direction”. Among the developments mentioned was the deployment of additional detectives, which meant case backlogs had decreased from 3,400 to just over 1,600. Case dockets per detective had decreased from 100 to 65. A number of vacant senior positions had also been filled and vigilante incidents were reducing, the premier’s office said.

At the time, SJC senior researcher Dalli Weyers challenged the premier’s report. “In the court papers filed by SAPS in the Police Resources court case, it was revealed that in January this year, the three stations in Khayelitsha combined had 10 less detectives than they had in April 2013. Even if those numbers have since changed, this is not steady progress,” Weyers said.

In August 2014, a final report and a set of 20 recommendations had been handed over to a task team consisting of senior police representatives, civil society representatives and Department of Community Safety (DCS) officials. Some of these were directed at the City of Cape Town, others at the provincial government, at IPID, but most of them were directed at the SAPS.

Our first issue is that the police minister has not acknowledged the report. We understand that in 2012 the police ministry attempted to oppose the Commission and lost.

If you look at the trend across the country, white affluent communities have better and more police resources,” he said. “So the court’s decision will have an impact in other communities as well.

In nearly three weeks, none responded.

Provincial Minister for Community Safety Dan Plato said no relief was being sought from the provincial department directly and that the Department of Community Safety had “no operational control over policing activities”. However, he said, as a member of the task team, they would not oppose the application and would abide by any ruling of the court. “This is specifically because the department and Western Cape Government has highlighted over the last five years the insufficiencies in resource deployment throughout the province, most notably historical under-staffing of police in the province and the unequal distribution of SAPS resources where police stations in high crime rate areas too often do not have the necessary resources to adequately serve the community,” he said. The Provincial SAPS had endeavoured to implement recommendations as far as possible, he added.

Plato said that in 2016 the Department conducted research on the allocation of human resources in the Western Cape, and specifically at six police stations as part of a national project of the Civilian Secretariat of Police. “The report analyses the effectiveness of the THRR as a tool to determine the required strength of the police at station level,” he told Daily Maverick. “Taking budgetary constraints into consideration, National Treasury allocates the budget to SAPS and approves the number of posts, which is far less than what is determined via the THRR. The number of granted of funded posts is roughly 68% of the theoretical requirement.” Based on budgetary constraints, Plato said, it was “unlikely” that one would find a station currently staffed at its theoretical capacity.

Thus far the allocation of resources by the Provincial Commissioner seems to be informed and influenced by crime and crime pattern analysis at any given time. The department’s research report calls for greater clarity around the determination of resource allocation to police stations,” he said.
