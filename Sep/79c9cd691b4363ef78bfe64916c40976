       Rumours of an impending Cabinet reshuffle are on the backburner for now as all eyes in the ANC are fixed on the aftermath of the recent court battle in KwaZulu-Natal. The leaders elected at the 2015 provincial conference, which has now been declared unlawful and void, are still clinging on.

While President Jacob Zuma at the special national executive committee meeting on Friday argued in favour of the provincial leadership – that they should stay put and appeal the judgment – the majority opinion in the NEC is that the leadership should be disbanded and replaced by a provincial task team that reflects both camps.

On Monday the two groups went head to head in the Musa Dladla region around Empangeni on the north coast, less than 20km apart – and both held their “cadre forums” (now a codeword for presidential campaigns) at the same time of the morning. There was no space for two-timing.

This could find some fertile ground in a province that supported Zuma’s campaign a decade ago on the same principle.

KwaZulu-Natal is the ANC’s biggest province and is set to play a significant role in the outcome of the party’s elections in December, but recent movements in the so-called “Premier League”, which has up to now supported Dlamini-Zuma, mean this fight could be fiercer.

Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza jumped ship from the Dlamini-Zuma camp just prior to the ANC’s policy conference two months ago, and there have been indications that North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo and Free State Premier Ace Magashule are re-thinking their support for her too.

His grip seems to be loosening a bit.

This will also be reflective of the fight among those in the top six, particularly Zuma and Mantashe. They have had some face-offs in the past, such as the time when Zuma seemingly endorsed Andile Lungisa’s candidacy for Nelson Mandela Bay regional chairperson in the Eastern Cape, while Mantashe ruled against it because Lungisa already was a member of the provincial executive council.
