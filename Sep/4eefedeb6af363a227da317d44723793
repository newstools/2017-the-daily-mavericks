       Judge Yasmin Shenaz Meer ruled on Wednesday that “information about the private funding of political parties and independent ward candidates… is reasonably required for the effective exercise of the right to vote… and to make political choices”. In doing so, the judge inextricably linked the constitutional rights of access to information in Section 32 of the Constitution and political rights in Section 19 that every citizen is free to make political choices.

It got here because political parties declined the Paia requests to disclose their funding brought by My Vote Counts last year. The requests for access to this information came after the Constitutional Court in September 2015 dismissed the civil society organisation’s push for Parliament to pass legislation for political funding disclosure. Against Parliament’s argument that Paia was the appropriate and adequate tool for access to information, and by passing that law the national legislature had discharged its legislative duties, the Constitutional Court found that My Vote Counts should have challenged the constitutionality of Paia, including how it is implemented.

And so the civil society organisation went back to the drawing board. In 2016 it submitted Paia applications to all 13 political parties represented in Parliament, but it was fobbed off. Only four responses were received, all declining to provide information: the DA and IFP sent lawyers’ letters, the FF+ and African Independent Congress (AIC) polite refusals. And so it was back to court at the start of 2017 for My Vote Counts, as Paia clearly had not provided the necessary disclosure transparency.

The Western Cape High Court judgment, which will have to be confirmed by the Constitutional Court as it deals with constitutional issues, is the latest step in a years-old debacle. In 2004 the Western Cape High Court dismissed an Idasa application for disclosure of private donors to the ANC, IFP and the then Democratic Party and New National Party. At the time, the ANC undertook to legislate party-political funding, but despite its 2007 Polokwane and 2012 Mangaung national conference resolutions to this effect, this did not happen until earlier this year. Opposition Private Members’ Bills by the IFP and DA had come to nought.

According to the document, the ANC with 528 national and provincial legislators received R74.4-million of the available R133,719,172. The DA and its 180 public representatives in the national and provincial legislatures received R28.9-million and the EFF R10.8-million for its 55 legislators. Included financial statements show that while the ANC and DA spent the majority of its money on salaries, the EFF spent most of it on rallies and events.

Wednesday’s judgment has been welcomed by Vincent Smith, the ANC MP who chairs the ad hoc committee that recently released a draft Political Party Funding Bill for public comment. “It reinforces the view that there must be disclosure. Paia will allow it (disclosure), but we still have to regulate the funding,” Smith said. “For us it is a victory. It will make it more important that what we do must be done with a lot of thought.” Wednesday’s judgment has been welcomed by Vincent Smith, the ANC MP who chairs the ad hoc committee that recently released a draft Political Party Funding Bill for public comment. “It reinforces the view that there must be disclosure.

Aside from establishing a multiparty democracy fund for private donations in addition to the existing Represented Political Parties Fund for public monies, the draft Bill proposes a ban on party-political donations from foreign governments and individuals, state-owned entities and the National Lottery. The draft Bill sets out a disclosure regime under the auspices of the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC). Disclosure of such private party-political donations, whether in cash or kind, is envisaged through annual declarations to the commission, much along the lines of what happens currently with the public funding.

But there are issues. The draft law does not cover local government, be it the political party or independent election candidates, which are drawn into the disclosure net following Wednesday’s judgment.

Buoyed by Wednesday’s court victory, Ogle said it would be up to Parliament now as to how to deal with party-political funding disclosure. “Whether the regulation takes place through Paia or another piece of legislation, it’s up to Parliament,” she said. “We remain cautiously optimistic.
