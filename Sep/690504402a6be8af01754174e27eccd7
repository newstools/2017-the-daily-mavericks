       This past week has once again been the stage for the annual South African debate over how Heritage Day should, could, and will be celebrated. And then, just to make things interesting, just how much ire is appropriate to be directed somewhere over all the wink-wink-nudge-nudging that goes on whenever someone calls the day, informally, National Braai Day instead. Inevitably, since this is South Africa, this argument almost instantly takes on racial and ethnic overtones as well, with the braai-meisters, brandishing their tongs and secret basting sauces, being labelled as white South African throwbacks to a far less than glorious past.

Over the past month of September, I have explored several different ways South Africans have embraced – or argued with – the idea of commemorating their heritage or celebrating it. And I have listened as some have argued over whether events celebrating heritage are subliminally racialist by virtue of what is included or excluded.

The South African History Archive explains the holiday’s origins, saying, “Heritage Day is one of the newly created South African public holidays. It is a day in which all are encouraged to celebrate their cultural traditions in the wider context of the great diversity of cultures, beliefs, and traditions that make up the nation of South Africa.” The South African History Archive explains the holiday’s origins, saying, “Heritage Day is one of the newly created South African public holidays. It is a day in which all are encouraged to celebrate their cultural traditions in the wider context of the great diversity of cultures, beliefs, and traditions that make up the nation of South Africa.”        At least in KwaZulu-Natal, 24 September used to be Shaka’s Day, but after the non-racial Parliament left off that particular holiday from the national holidays list, thereby provoking the ire of the Inkatha Freedom Party, an eventual compromise was to create a holiday “where all South Africans could observe and celebrate their diverse cultural heritage”.

Communal celebration is a key element of Heritage Day, recalling, for an American at least, the words of John Adams (a co-drafter of the Declaration of Independence and second president of the new nation) on how best to commemorate the new holiday. Interestingly, he had claimed that 2 July – when the first signatures were affixed to the declaration – was the true, rightful day for commemoration.

Krotoa Krotoa Krotoa Krotoa  is a recent local film that has won awards at various international film festivals and was shown at local cinemas amid some significant controversy. It is a fictionalised depiction of the earliest years of the Dutch East India Company’s Cape settlement, back when Jan van Riebeeck was the governor of a rather ragtag settlement hugging the coast. The task of that settlement was to be prepared to provide fresh food and water to ships in transit to India and further east. Right from the first, the population was an amalgam of Dutch servants of the VOC, miscellaneous other Europeans, servants and slaves brought from those lands further east, and the indigenous KhoiKhoi inhabitants. Trade for cattle (along with an increasingly vicious cycle of the inevitable stock theft that became a sturdy part of the tragic South African version of the clash of civilisations) was a critically important part of that early Dutch settlement, but things go badly almost from the start of the film.   is a recent local film that has won awards at various international film festivals and was shown at local cinemas amid some significant controversy.

Enter the precocious, spunky 11-year-old Eva/Krotoa, niece of a local chief. Krotoa has the gift of language learning, as well as the ability to mediate between the VOC settlement and her own people, including an end to the first Dutch-KhoiKhoi conflict. Soon she is indentured to the Van Riebeeck household in order to turn her into a “proper young Dutch lady”, allowing her to grow into the role of interpreter/mediation specialist.

Things get complicated when a visiting French sea captain makes advances and Van Riebeeck himself sexually assaults her as well. Nonetheless, she marries a Danish soldier/doctor at the settlement and her skills make her increasingly valuable to the colony, until Van Riebeeck is recalled and the new governor has little use for her. Then her husband is killed in a skirmish in Madagascar (presumably in a slave-catching operation), and Krotoa has a lonely alcoholic prostitute’s death in early middle age.

The film’s visuals lavish attention upon the landscapes and sea coast vistas of the Cape, and although director Roberta Durrant has her Dutch colonists anachronistically speak Afrikaans even before that language has come into being, there seemed to be great effort to make the whole thing look as realistic as possible.

For her, despite the film’s flaws and sometime stark black and white characterisations of the various people on screen, she saw it as a chance to connect to a near-legendary figure and the first historically recognised KhoiKhoi person, and by being the mother of several children, a potential claimant to the title of progenitor of South Africa’s mixed race communities and population.
