This year s theme, Achieving Inclusive Growth through Responsive and Responsible Leadership is a fitting follow-on to the meeting held last year in Kigali. Last year the focus was on how Africa can benefit from the massive technological changes happening in the world termed the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The discussions highlighted the need for leaders and regulators to adapt and embrace these changes in order to allow the continent to benefit. In order to improve and grow manufacturing on the continent, an enabling environment is key and this was highlighted during last year s sessions. Reliable electricity, good transport infrastructure, efficient ports and borders as well as an enabling business environment are just some of the many things that are needed before local innovators and entrepreneurs can compete effectively on a world stage. The World Economic Forum launches its Africa Competitiveness Report during this year s meeting and this should enable governments and leaders to focus on areas that need improving in their countries and regions. Fittingly, many sessions at WEF Africa 2017 will focus on industrialisation and unlocking the industrial corridors across the continent. Last year Makhtar Diop, the Vice President for Africa at the World Bank, had the following words for the delegates, implementation, implementation, implementation . Highlighting how important leadership is for getting things done, these thoughts lead into this year s theme of responsive and responsible leadership. The final words at WEF Africa 2016 went to South Africa s then Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan, who invited all the delegates to the current Forum. He suggested to the organisers that more sessions need to be devoted to measuring the implementation of good policies, rather than discussing policy. Hopefully, WEF Africa, 2017 can live up to these expectations and truly show that the continent is on a growth path that will benefit all of its people.
