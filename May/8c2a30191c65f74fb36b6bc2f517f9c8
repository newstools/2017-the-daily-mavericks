There are shades of truth and untruth within its claims. The Boycott Spur campaign has not brought Spur to its knees, but as we will see it has had a profound effect on the livelihood of individual franchise owners. The founder of Spur, Allen Ambor, has indeed sold R100-million of his shares but unfortunately for Front Nasionaal, he put them up for sale some time before the March incident at the Texamo Spur.

It was an assault by a large male on a young child. It shouldn t even be reduced to a question of race. The aggression that lies under the surface in this country is crazy. The abuse of women and children in this country is pandemic. We are not going to sit by and allow one of those things to happen. I don t think it s appropriate to take a middle road: badly behaved individuals should not be allowed to eat in family restaurants. It was an assault by a large male on a young child.

Farrelly believes that much of the anger from certain sectors of the white Afrikaner population is based on the circulation of fake news and misconceptions about the incident. He says that most people only saw half the total video footage, and that the full footage which Spur has in its possession makes the situation crystal-clear. But we are not going to put that footage out to endanger a child, he says. We ve said: Come to our offices. You can view it there. But nothing leaves our premises .
