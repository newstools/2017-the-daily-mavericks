The City of Cape Town does a good job of providing basic information about the city s dwindling water supply. Dam levels are updated weekly on the municipality s site, which also provides information on all the dams providing water to the city.

As part of GroundUp s special series on Cape Town s water crisis, we set out to find historic data on rainfall, dam levels and water consumption. The goal was to collect the data, present it to experts who could interpret it for us, and provide our readers with an easily digestible story.

SAWS representatives said data extending back to 2002 would cost R1,518. This is just 20% of the full tariff, because as a news organisation GroundUp qualified for reduced pricing. This means the normal price is R7,590. We would also have had to sign a form limiting how available we could make this data. SAWS representatives said data extending back to 2002 would cost R1,518.
