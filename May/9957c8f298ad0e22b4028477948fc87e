Scott Comment is free, but facts are sacred It is well known that politicians lie to get ahead. For some, it is simply the name of the game. The art is not so much in lying, it s in getting away with it. There are different ways to play this game. You can argue about semantics, as Bill Clinton did when he endeavoured to debate what the meaning of is is . Or it can be the argument that others have used where they base their decision on shady dossiers that are later shown to be dodgy or sexed-up . Others, such as Donald Trump, have spent years on efforts to create a narrative or a context in which their world view prevails, through TV channels such as Fox News, or even, as Zizi Kodwa may agree these days, the Guptas and President Jacob Zuma through ANN7.

But, generally s In just the last few weeks some of our senior politicians have been caught pretty much outright in lying. One of the best examples is the intelligence report used by President Jacob Zuma as his first justification for the sacking of Pravin Gordhan as Finance Minister. We first heard about it from the SACP just before the reshuffle. When the DA went to court and won an order demanding that it be produced, the Presidency, in a manoeuvre that was truly breathtaking in its Kellyanne Conway-level mendacity, tried to demand that the DA in fact produce it, and then appeared to suggest it did not ever exist. Which is a pity for the Presidency, because we have eyewitnesses to the fact that it does, or at least, once did.

As far back as 2009 he claimed that the money he received from Schabir Shaik was a loan. Since then, there is no public evidence or public statement that he has repaid it.

She suggested during a cadres forum in Sasolburg that children at Model C schools were taught that the ANC is corrupt, that some universities refused to allow South Africa to be called a democracy , and that banks had given their workers a day off to march against Zuma.

Take the Sunday Times story this last weekend that Presidency Minister Jeff Radebe had been in the habit of sending text messages which we will under-describe as salacious to a Union Buildings worker about two generations younger than himself. For many, the first instinct upon hearing of it would be to write it off as the work of Zuma s intelligence services, to shrug and predict that we are going to get more of these stories over the next few months, that by the end of it, everyone will be covered in a thick coating of mud.

The Sunday Times did a proper work of journalism here, and as a result the public has been properly informed about the kind of man Radebe now appears to be. And this does matter. Politicians often campaign on trust: Radebe has tried in the public domain to be one of those people you can believe.

The scary part of all of this is that for our politics to actually work, for politicians to be held accountable, and for the entire system to move along in any way, it is vital that the minds of voters can change, and be changed. If the minds of voters are going to stay the same, we will be locked into one pattern forever, and those in power will know that and act accordingly.

When it appears that all politicians are liars, a tendency can set in to either ignore politics altogether and not vote, or to just vote as one always does. People can hunker down into their identity bunkers, and surround themselves with only those who agree with them, or share the same identity. They will give up following the opinions of people they disagree with, and simply switch off when other politicians try to convince them to change their minds.
