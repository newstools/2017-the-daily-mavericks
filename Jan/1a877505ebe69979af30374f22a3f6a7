GroundUp asked SAPS why it takes so long for the state to do DNA testing, but the police referred us to the Western Cape Department of Health. The department s Forensic Pathology Services eventually referred us back to SAPS: We are only responsible for the autopsy which is to get the cause of the death, and we give our findings to the police. We do not get involved with DNA [testing] because it is part of the investigation that the police do, said spokesperson Darren Francis.
