The formal nomination of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma by the ANC Women s League appeared to have caught most parts of the ANC by surprise. It was an unexpected move, and may have been deliberately timed to steal part of the show from the National Executive Committee s (NEC) January 8th Statement. But in the fuss, not a lot of attention was paid to the full statement, and the other people it also wants to accompany Dlamini-Zuma into the upper echelons of the ANC.

But since she became deputy secretary-general, something seems to have changed. She appears to have claimed (on ANN7 no less) that the Reserve Bank was allowing the rand to fall in value, because it was privately owned.

Unfortunately, it is the next person on our list who really demonstrates the lack of thought by the Women s League. Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has managed to embarrass herself in every public role given to her. She was a disaster at Home Affairs, didn t seem to grasp Correctional Services, and became the first Defence Minister since 1994 to confine every member of the military to base.

And that s just in her public life. Unfortunately, Mapisa-Nqukula has shown that she is quite happy to use her position to break the law if it serves her private life. She is responsible for the quite unbelievable crime of smuggling a young woman into the country . And she used a government jet to do it. Amazingly, when confronted with confirmation of this, she simply said that she would do it again, if she had to. Considering how difficult it can be for parents to arrange for their children to travel, it is simply incredible that this happened. At the very least, it is a demonstration of all that is wrong with the ANC; the arrogance, the belief that the law does not exist if you are a minister, and the utter craziness that seems to be inflicting some people in high office.

In any political campaign, it is important to consider the whole picture you have to think things through. The inclusion of Lindiwe Sisulu on this list is proof that it has not been properly considered. Not because of any questions about her competence (there aren t any). But because Sisulu appears on this list just hours after Sipho Pityana addressed the funeral of her late husband, Professor Rok Ajulu. It was obvious that Pityana was going to use the opportunity to attack the ANC of President Jacob Zuma. This he did. How then can Sisulu be a part of a campaign for the leadership with Dlamini-Zuma?

At the end of last year, this publication started reporting on what looks like an imminent crisis that could affect everyone who receives a social grant. In a nutshell, it appears the Social Development Department is not ready to take over the payment system from the company Cash Paymaster Services. If this is not sorted out, it s not being alarmist to say that this would be the biggest unnatural disaster to hit this country since 1994. Millions, and we mean millions, could go hungry. Imagine the anger of people who already have almost nothing. The response from the department has been to almost ignore it. Certainly, no proper plans have been laid out .
