That s not to say there s no interest: recent news, for instance, includes investigation of a baffling rogue planet-like object baffling rogue planet-like object orbiting a tiny star quite nearby exomoons orbiting lunar outpost study of gravitational waves DM: It s hard to give a complete answer. But here are some: the discovery of exoplanets exoplanets DM: DM DM: The fact that so far we only know of single planets around a given star lies in that we only find the largest and innermost planets. The James Webb telescope (JWST JWST Large Synoptic Survey Telescope DM DM There is, of course, also SETI SETI DM: ASKAP in Australia produces data cubes that no software today can handle, so they need to degrade the data); simulations based on finer and finer resolutions and that is the only way we can make reliable predictions close to the regime of mathematical chaos. DM DM : In the search for exoplanets, CFBDSIR 2149-0403 CFBDSIR 2149-0403 Jocelyn Bell persevered to find out what really caused it and found a new class of astronomical objects that no one had thought of before. Quasars are another example. Every astronomer dreams of making such a discovery. DM DM DM DM
