Sophia is a 36-year-old farmworker with four children, three of whom are on child support grants. For three long months, her grants just disappeared, eaten up by insurance and repayments on two loans, one of them fraudulent. Sophia hoped that she could pay for someone to look after her children so that she could work on the farm for R735 a week. With the grants and her salary, she felt she could provide what her children needed. But then she fell pregnant again, and could no longer work on the farm.

On 29 September, XY Loans deducted R512 in two separate transactions of R256 to confirm her account. On September 30, XY Loans reimbursed those two transactions and loaded the R256 loan to her account. On the very same day, which was the day Sophia s grant was paid, XY Loans made a further five deductions of R256 (R1,280). Because of the XY loan, Moneyline loan and Smart Life policy, Sophia was left with only R43.63. When she tried to access more information, she was also hit for R23.43 in EasyPay fees for balance inquiries and having insufficient funds in her account.

This is exactly the nightmare creditor scenario that allows Net1 to claim that its companies provide a better, more reliable service than the unscrupulous moneylenders which prey on the poor. But it is the Grindrod bank account, affiliated to CPS and Net1, that enables Sophia s crisis.

These regulations were intended to stop all deductions from the Sassa-branded Grindrod accounts with the exception of one funeral policy, which amounts to no more than 10% of the grant, on pensions and disability grants. These regulations have been challenged in the Pretoria High Court by several companies including Net1 and two of its subsidiaries.

In October 2016, Net1, FinBond Mutual Bank and SmartLife Insurance Company (both subsidiaries of Net1), and Information Technology Consultants (not affiliated to Net1) argued in court that the minister s new regulations were invalid and she had overstepped her jurisdiction by attempting to intervene in the banking sector.

Net1 and its affiliates argued that the court should interpret the new regulations to restrict deductions before grants are paid into beneficiary accounts, but not after grants are paid. They argued that though Sassa deposits a lump sum into CPS s account, CPS is only allowed to pay funeral policies for pension and disability grant holders; once the remaining money is deposited into the individual accounts of grant recipients, these recipients should be free to use their money as they choose. Net1 contended that to limit deductions made after the grant is paid would be tantamount to inhibiting the freedom of grant beneficiaries.

While Sassa is focused on stopping deductions on the Sassa-Grindrod account, the EasyPay-Grindrod account has hardly been investigated. Once beneficiaries, like Sophia, have been issued an EasyPay card, and a second Grindrod account has been opened in their name, protections are even fewer and fees are even higher, since they can no longer use free pay points.

Yet, because she had an EasyPay card, she was turned away. She visited the EasyPay consultant every time he came to her town: on October 14, November 14 and December 14. She demanded to see her account statements. Three times, she was told he would bring the statements the following month, but he never did.

In February 2017 I met Sophia, with the Black Sash, at a community meeting led by its partner organisation, the Witzenberg Rural Development Centre. Together we drove more than 50km to the nearest Net1 Financial Services office. Sophia asked for a print-out of her account statement from September 1, 2016. We sat in the waiting room for over an hour as consultants emerged from the back to request her ID and, 30 minutes later, her EasyPay card. They also took cellphone pictures of us.

Since the loan was taken in September, Sophia should have been on her final instalment. But when we asked for the outstanding total, the consultant made a phone call, and told us the only person with computer access had gone home early. An hour and several bungled scans and e-mails later, we were told Sophia should pay R660.

The Terms and Conditions of Smart Life also say that policies can be cancelled at any time at any Net1 Financial Services Branch. Sophia, however, was told that the policy could not be cancelled immediately because the scanner did not recognise her fingerprint. She had taken the policy from a mobile consultant, who drives around to villages with paper forms, and thus her policy could not be accessed in the computer system. Instead, she would have to fill out a manual cancellation policy and wait 30 to 60 days.
