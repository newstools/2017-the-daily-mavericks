Landmark victory for Alabama Democrat, UN funding drawdown by US, and major GPS project launches more satellites.  1 Wednesday, 13 December 2017   “I have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them.” Baruch Spinoza   STORY OF THE DAY   amaBhungane and Scorpio #GuptaLeaks: A tale of two captures – Alexkor, Gupta Inc and ‘WMC’   By AMABHUNGANE and SCORPIO   The legendary Grootslang of the Richtersveld is a primordial cross between an elephant and a snake. Now the Richtersveld seems beset by the massive dominance, on the one hand, of the Alexkor elephant and, on the other, by a shelf-company whose corporate coils seem to lead back inexorably to the Guptas. And in the background lurks the presence of a Grootslang that survived: Trans Hex, the company controlled by that old giant of White Monopoly Capital, Christo Wiese.  1 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING   Jones unseats Roy Moore   Alabama's Senate tussle left child abuse-accused Republican Roy Moore out in the cold, shaving down the party's Senate majority to just a single seat. Jones' win has been perceived as a rejection of divisive state and national politics. Moore, accused of child abuse and sexual assault, was ultimately defeated by a massive voter turn-out after intense campaigning on both sides.  3 US demands major cuts to UN budget   The United States is looking to cut $250-million from the core budget of the United Nations in 2018-2019. The 5% cut would possibly focus on UN missions in Libya, Afghanistan, and Palestinian rights and communications services. The last office, given recent affairs, is probably considered a bonus of the massive cut proposed.   Crack found in Japan bullet train   For the first time in its history, the Japanese "bullet" train has had a serious incident. A large crack and oil leak was discovered on one of the carriages as it pulled out of station heading towards Nagoya. This is the only time such a serious flaw has been discovered mid-journey. This kind of incident would be called "Wednesday" by most other passenger rail companies.   European GPS satellites launched   Four more satellites of a 30-satellite project were launched today. The Ariane 5 rocket took off from Kourou Space Centre. When eventually online, the GPS network will provide an accurate position to within a metre. Soon you will be able to get lost with your direction device to an even more precise degree.   IN NUMBERS   53m   The height of a hill in Rome that was made mostly of broken amphora shards.   FACTS OF THE DAY   Today in 1949 the Knesset votes to move the capital of Israel to Jerusalem.   Synchronised swimmers have a high risk of concussions due to kicking each other in the head.
