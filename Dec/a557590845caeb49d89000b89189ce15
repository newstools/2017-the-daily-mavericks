The taps may have run dry in Sandton on Thursday 23 November, 2017, but the conversation flowed at Daily Maverick’s The Gathering, held at the convention centre. Here is a video clip from the first session of the day, How did we get here?      The opening panel was moderated by Bongani Bingwa, who spoke to ANC veteran Mavuso Msimang, cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro (Zapiro) and former ANC MP rebel Makhosi Khoza.
