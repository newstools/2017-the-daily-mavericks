The taps may have run dry in Sandton on Thursday 23 November, 2017, but the conversation flowed at Daily Maverick’s The Gathering, held at the convention centre. Here is a video clip of a powerful interaction with former ANC MP and anti-corruption activist Andrew Feinstein.     Feinstein, who now lives in London, spoke to journalist and author Marianne Thamm.   Read our report that was published on the day of the event here. DM   Photo: Andrew Feinstein at The Gathering: ‘The current nuclear deal will make the Arms Deal seem like small change, both in the scale of its corruption and its corrosive impact on our democracy … The last two people on the planet one would want negotiating such a deal are Messrs Vladimir Putin and Jacob Zuma.’ Photo: Daniel Born.
