The taps may have run dry in Sandton on Thursday 23 November, 2017, but the conversation flowed at Daily Maverick’s The Gathering, held at the convention centre. One of the many stand-out moments was when Pravin Gordhan, the axed finance minister, spoke to STEPHEN GROOTES.      Read our report on the discussion with Gordhan that was published here.
