The taps may have run dry in Sandton on Thursday 23 November, 2017, but the conversation flowed at Daily Maverick’s The Gathering, held at the convention centre. Here is a video clip from the second session of the day, a conversation with Zimbabwean opposition politician Tendai Biti.    The conversation with the former Zimbabwean foreign minister was led by Stephen Grootes.   To recap on our report on this conversation, click here and here.   Watch out for publication of video clips of the rest of the day’s activities over the coming days.
