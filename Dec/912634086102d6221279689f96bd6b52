The taps may have run dry in Sandton on Thursday 23 November, 2017, but the conversation flowed at Daily Maverick’s The Gathering, held at the convention centre. Here is a video clip of a lively conversation that Katy Katopodis hosted on the topic – What Future South Africa?    Panellists were UDM leader Bantu Holomisa, businessman and Save SA convenor Sipho Pityana and academic and writer Nomboniso Gasa.    Read our report that was published on the day of the event here.
