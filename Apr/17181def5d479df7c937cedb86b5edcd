The visiting group made a series of resolutions, including an extension of the cessation of hostilities between them and the government forces until the end of June. Pledges to convene a meeting to discuss some of the concerns cited by Hilu were also raised but whether these concessions will be enough to assure the rebel movement s unity remains to be seen.

Hilu s letter is an impassioned defence of the SPLA-N s armed struggle. It questions whether the leadership s alleged lack of democratic rule and conciliatory tone in the peace talks adequately represents the Nuba people who have made considerable sacrifices to the rebel movement. According to the letter, the movement lacks a manifesto to guide them, for instance, and political bodies designed to develop democratic leadership were never formed, leaving decisions to the arbitrary will of the secretary-general. The movement continues without a manifesto except for individuals efforts and personal views, this is the basis of the problem, Hilu writes in his letter, (and) when the disagreement goes beyond to the principles and directions (of the movement), the problem begins.

One of the key concerns Hilu highlights is the continuous lowering of the ceiling of the SPLM-N demands vis- -vis the Sudan government during peace talks. This is especially acute, Hilu says, in the demand for the right to self-determination and waiver of security arrangements. According to the letter, the negotiating stance SPLM-N took in 2002, demanding either a secular, democratic Sudan or the right to self-determination, has dissipated under the present leadership. While the current priority for the Nuba people is for a more egalitarian, unified Sudan, Hilu told Nuba Reports , the right for voluntary unity for the Nuba people must remain intact at the negotiating table.

In August last year, the SPLM-N leadership also reneged on an earlier January internal agreement to ensure the SPLA-N remain a standing army for 20 years until the implementation of a peace agreement is realised, Hilu stated in his letter. Instead, the SPLM-N peace talk negotiators have agreed to assimilate the rebel army into the national forces if a comprehensive peace agreement is achieved. The waiver of security arrangements means, in my view, that the SPLA-N is disarmed by means of assimilation into the National Congress partisan army, Hilu writes, ending its role as guarantor of any agreement, or as a tool of pressure to achieve democratic transformation and just peace. With the ruling party s history of breaching agreements, Hilu said in an interview with Nuba Reports , Sudan is set to disarm the rebel army and then go back to exclusionary policies against the Nuba and other marginalised people like it is doing right now in Darfur .

The rebel leadership has agreed to address Hilu s concerns during a convention to be held in June, Agar added. The latest press statement by the SPLM addressed several of Hilu s consternations including future plans to draft a manifesto and to form a more democratic, political body - the National Liberation Council. The statement acknowledges the flaws in the organisation, Hilu concedes, but still lacks a commitment to democratic values. The leadership criticised and rejected the stance of the regional council, the Nuba Mountains Liberation Council, only to commandeer their stance as their own, Hilu says.
