 I m still to hear what was going on, including what happened that we ended up all speaking like that and when I have a full understanding of that maybe I can comment. Mbete appeared to disagree with the decision of the other ANC top six officials to speak out on the reshuffle. ANC leaders will meet on Monday at Luthuli House. Mbete said she was at the meeting on Monday where Zuma discussed replacing the minister and deputy minister of finance. We did not discuss an intelligence report. The president talked about it. We did not see it. We did not discuss it, so there was no question about agreeing or not agreeing on it, said Mbete. It was part of a package of issues that the president touched on as a background. Mbete said the president called her on Thursday and said he was reshuffling cabinet, but he didn't explain the details of the decision.
