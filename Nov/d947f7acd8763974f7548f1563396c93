That McKinsey was paid just over R1-billion, and Trillian R565-million, by Eskom without work being done first emerged in the amaBhungane and Scorpio #GuptaLeaks, but has been confirmed on public record by both firms amid assertions of no wrongdoing.

Mothepu, who had worked there first from 2007 to 2010 and again from June 2015, together with colleagues, was transferred to Trillian. The plan was for Regiments Capital to cede its various public sector contracts, although that was not formally done, MPs heard: “Trillian had taken the public sector contracts without the cession being approved.” This is the subject of a court battle.

This disclosure was leaked – this triggered the Budlender inquiry by then Trillian Capital Partners non-executive chairman Tokyo Sexwale – that led Trillian to lay criminal charges, including corruption, fraud and cyber crime, against Mothepu. While the case was taken to the Hawks at rapid speed, MPs heard that it has been for some time before the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for a decision on whether to prosecute or not.

The fact you don’t have the courage to say ‘no’ breeds the cancer,” she replied. “It comes at a great personal cost… I will not romanticise.

It is now more difficult to say, “We didn’t know.” Perhaps avoiding that was at least part of the motivation of a group of ANC MPs who in a recent caucus tried, unsuccessfully, to stop this inquiry, as well as others by, for example, the trade and industry committee into the localisation of Transnet’s locomotive tender involving a Chinese company and financing.

After Nene was sacked, Mothepu’s colleague Mohammed Bobat was appointed as ministerial adviser to the newly, albeit short-lived, finance minister Des van Rooyen. “(Bobat’s) role, essentially, was to channel all the work from state-owned companies or National Treasury to Trillian,” she said.
