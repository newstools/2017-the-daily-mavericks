Images of old South Africans flags – some taken on Monday, others dredged up from a protest back in 2010 – ignited social media, and served as a powerful reminder of how little some in this community have changed. It also suggests that many members of this community do not feel part of South Africa, and would be more comfortable in the South Africa of the 1980s. Reported renditions of Die Stem, of people holding each other while praying, and the general tone was of the kind of exclusionary racism of 1980s South Africa.

While the racism underlying it cannot be condoned, it may also have been a sign of the stress this group feels it is under. When under intense stress people often go back to their core identities; the expressions we saw on Monday may be a result of this. The problem is that this core identity includes racism and that cannot be acceptable.

Until the 1980s, the IFP only allowed Zulu people to join, and then it continued to be based mainly in KwaZulu-Natal. It would always win some votes in Gauteng, mainly due to people from KZN who live there – famously the Nancefield Hostel in Soweto was an IFP stronghold during the violence of the early 1990s.

This is despite the fact that its parliamentary caucus does contain white and Indian people – a main difference with AfriForum: while the IFP has been able to pick up a tiny sliver of support from people of other identities, the FF+ have not.

It is much easier to win the support of a small group of people, and to keep it, than it is in a bigger, more diverse group of people. You don’t have to worry too much about factions (and in the case of the Freedom Front Plus, everyone seems related to each other anyway). Also, succession is easier to manage.

The IFP received just 2.4% of the vote in 2014, the FF+ 0.9%. That means, except for exceptional circumstances, involving the need for coalitions, or to break the tightest of ties, their voices mean, or achieve, almost nothing.

In a country where there are so many different shades of humanity, and where many leaders rely on identity politics, it shows that as a strategy it simply does not work. The two main parties, the ANC and the DA, are both incredibly broad coalitions. They include black people who speak different languages, white people who speak both English and Afrikaans, coloured people from different parts of the country, and Indian people. Anyone who has sat through the opening prayers/thoughts/meditations of an ANC conference can attest to how many different people are represented in that party.

This also suggests that if the route to political power in South Africa lies through creating broad and diverse coalitions, it would make it very difficult for any party to come to power through excluding any group. In other words, if the ANC were to become seen as an “anti-white party”, that could be the start of a journey that ends with it splitting along language lines.

And it is often forgotten that there are many political leaders who actually succeed through division; the more they can divide people, the stronger they are. Donald Trump is the perfect example of this, Zuma has played this game too from time to time, and anyone who claims that black people would be traitors for thinking of voting for someone other than the ANC is also engaging in this.

But it is a fact worth celebrating that the gains that are won through this tactic appear to be limited.
