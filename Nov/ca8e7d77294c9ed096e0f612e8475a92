       In writing about international relations, it is common to identify big, overarching, transcendent geopolitical themes, and then massage the evidence to suit the model being offered up for contemplation. A sophisticated version of this approach might well be Prof Graham Allison’s new book, the provocatively titled Thucydides Trap, which argues that the US and China are almost certain to bump heads militarily unless something changes dramatically, in the manner of Sparta versus Athens nearly two-and-a-half-thousand years earlier.

Alternatively, among the political studies literature, there is the tendency to focus tightly on a major leader and describe or analyse his or her decisions in terms of their impact. This is something like the difference between the old adage that says: grave crises give rise to great men to deal with them, and its converse, the possibility that great men produce those grave crises.

Missing in all of this, of course, is a real focus on the power of ideas and their impact upon society, rather than just a simple roster of all those great figures worthy of those statues in public squares, or yet one more fight about whether a statue of a formerly revered and now-reviled autocrat should remain in place or be hoisted out of the park with a heavy lift helicopter and then taken off to be dumped at a retirement home for images of outmoded politicians.

Interestingly, these past two weeks give us important examples to contemplate in thinking about a rather different way of looking at the great machinery of history – the power and impact of ideas on great masses of men and women in their own time and well beyond. On 31 October 1517, the Augustinian priest, Martin Luther, nailed his epochal “95 Theses” on a door of the castle church in Wittenberg to protest against the selling of indulgences by the church to well-to-do sinners – and 94 other complaints. A hundred years ago, on 7-8 November 1917 (or, if you prefer, 24-25 October, if you are still clinging to the Gregorian calendar), the Russian Communist Party carried out a coup against the government in place that had already overthrown the old czarist order six months earlier. And in that same year, on 2 November, the wartime British cabinet issued its “Balfour Declaration” that announced its support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in what was then Ottoman Turkish territory, comprising parts of three vilayets (territorial jurisdictions like counties or magisterial districts) of that increasingly creaky empire.

Moreover, Luther’s religiously revolutionary exhortations came along just as the social media of the 16th century had hit its stride in the form of printing with moveable type after its development in the mid-1400s in Mainz. Printers quickly took up Luther’s writings and they were distributed across much of Europe – where they were eagerly read by those who were already literate, and listened to by those who were not. Luther’s pronouncements on the established Roman Catholic Church, the centrality of the individual’s direct relationship to the deity and the importance of personal revelation, and the Bible as the core of belief, rather than all those other encrustations and elaborations, had come in tandem with an explosion of the publishing of that Bible in vernacular translations from the Latin, Hebrew and Greek.

This development allowed almost anyone to draw their individual religious fervour from the holy words (and Luther’s missives), rather than the more obscure pronouncements of a priest or the corrupt practices of the clergy in selling forgiveness. Benedict O’Grady Anderson, the great cultural anthropologist, had dubbed this explosion in information accessibility as the sudden advent of “print capitalism” and termed the result occasioned by this great change as a longing for “imagined communities” where people would now draw upon the printed word to inspire their hopes for a new way of existence, unshackled from those old verities.

Along the way, Luther’s revolution broke the spell of the universality (at least in the west) of there being just one true church, instead now allowing individual monarchs and other princes to select which pathway they and their subjects might follow. The papal decision issued at the end of the 15th century, which had airily divided the new worlds opened up by Columbus and the rest of the voyagers solely to Spain and Portugal, would have become unthinkable just a few decades later. And, of course, the revolution in religious thinking also led to a century of increasingly fierce religiously inspired struggles across Europe, culminating in the Thirty Years War. The conclusion of that war in 1648 gave birth to the modern nation state through the Westphalian treaties.

Wearied by the terrible casualty lists and a long roster of lost battles and disastrous troop retreats, growing food and other goods shortages in the cities, and a real sense that the czarist regime under Nicholas II was unable to cope with the growing chaos, the anger led to a rebellion in February that forced the czar’s abdication and the establishment of a moderate socialist government under Alexander Kerensky.

From 1917 onward, through to the end of the Soviet Union under Boris Yeltsin/Mikhail Gorbachev, despite its real history as a shockingly repressive, authoritarian regime throughout its run, its leadership cadre had virtually no compunction about doing whatever seemed to be in the service of the creation of their secular utopia, as defined by the party. In practice, this often meant the death by starvation of millions of peasant farmers resisting collectivisation in the Ukraine and elsewhere. It also meant purging many thousands more from the ruling party and government after fictitious show trials, with verdicts usually delivered on specious grounds; and then sending an untold number of such people – plus many others who resisted authoritarianism in one way or another – off to that “Gulag Archipelago” of brutal prison work camps, mines and other punitive facilities. Whereupon, they usually died from hunger, disease, or overwork.

After World War II, among the hundreds of thousands of surviving European Jews, for many, any return to their homes had become impossible, given the economic scarcities, the destruction of their communities, and even the eruptions of pogroms against them after the defeat of Germany in places like Poland.
