Since being sworn in as Democratic Alliance mayor of Joburg through a coalition agreement with other opposition parties after the 2016 local government elections, Mashaba has focused on “cleaning up” the city by attempting to reclaim hijacked buildings in the inner city.

And if the City is to evict them, it has to provide temporary accommodation to the residents as per the Prevention of Illegal Eviction Act and a recent constitutional court ruling that found that evictions are legal if it does not lead to homelessness.
