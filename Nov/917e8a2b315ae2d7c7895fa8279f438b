Despite the fact that she was hailed as Mrs Clean when she turned around qualified audits when she was minister of home affairs in 2011 (the audits were clean for the first time since 1995), and despite the fact that she’s known as a strict technocrat, she’s not immune to skeletons either.

Jill of all trades but really, mistress of none, Carien has of late been a political tourist chasing elections and summits in various parts of the world, especially in Africa.  After spending her student days at political rallies in South Africa right through the country's first democratic elections in 1994, and after an extended working holiday in London, Carien started working for newspapers full-time in 2003. She's pretty much had her share of reporting on South African politics, attending gatherings and attracting trolls, but still finds herself attracted to it like a moth to a veld fire.  Her ultimate ambition in life is to become a travelling chocolate writer of international fame.
