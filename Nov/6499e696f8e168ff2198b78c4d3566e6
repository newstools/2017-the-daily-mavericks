The state has spent much of the last four days cross-examining four members of the Komape family, trying to extract admissions from them that the Department of Education had actually supported them with financial and other assistance after Michael’s death. The family, while conceding some support from the department in the week of the funeral, has steadfastly resisted the suggestion that the department has been as caring and attentive as the state has tried to make out.

If the offer of R450,000 was “insulting”, Phaswane asked Lucas Komape, then it suggested the family was expecting a larger amount of money from the state. He pressed Lucas Komape for a figure that would satisfy him. Lucas replied that it was a matter for his parents and their legal advisers.

This line of questioning was similar to that pursued on Wednesday against Michael’s eldest sister, Lydia. Phaswane expressed his disbelief at the testimony of both Lydia and Lucas that the family was so traumatised by the death of Michael that they did not discuss it among themselves. Only when public interest law centre SECTION27 paid for psychological counselling did the members of the family open up about the trauma and undignified manner of Michael’s passing.

They want to prevent a similar tragedy from happening to another child who belongs to another family in a country where an undignified death is treated as normal. We are disappointed that the state’s counsel described Lydia Komape’s description of the family’s reaction to Michael’s death as ‘unbelievable’. The counsel later accused Lydia Komape of lying for not acknowledging the paltry donations alleged to have been made by the Limpopo Department of Education soon after Michael’s death,” said the press statement.
