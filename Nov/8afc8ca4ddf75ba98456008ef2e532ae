All that means is that 19% of vulnerable South Africans suffered because [the Department of Social Development] planned but did not deliver,” said IFP MP Mntomuhle Khawula to officials from the Department of Social Development (DSD).

Khawula questioned officials on their budget allocation for some of their “overachieved” targets. “You say your target was to do 80 road shows but you ended up doing over 100. Where does the money come from? This says something is wrong with the department’s budget,” he said.

The DA’s Chris Hattingh said, “I’d be more interested to get a detailed report on the targets that were not achieved and why those were not met. Of the 11 substance abuse campaigns that were done, there is no indication of a special focus where people are being killed by drug lords, like in the Western Cape. We are losing the drug battle.” The DA’s Chris Hattingh said, “I’d be more interested to get a detailed report on the targets that were not achieved and why those were not met.

In fact we are getting worse. Most of the things in the report talks about plans, strategies and bills and not the crucial work that needs to be done on the ground,” she said.

Dlamini said not enough was being done to address the challenges involved in helping the elderly and people with disabilities. “If you had achieved 100% of your targets, you would’ve overspent. Why do you ask us to approve a budget of your own plans and then not follow it? I also want to know what happened to all the children whose court applications for foster care grants are still pending?” Dlamini said not enough was being done to address the challenges involved in helping the elderly and people with disabilities. “If you had achieved 100% of your targets, you would’ve overspent.

He added that there were about 20,000 fewer foster care grants given in 2016 due to court orders lapsing.

Asked why more substance abuse facilities are not being built in areas where they are most needed, Deputy Minister of Social Development, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, said the delays were because of “provincial politics”. She said premiers often “made her job difficult” when trying to start the projects. “I acknowledge that the report should be compiled better to include what we are actually doing and what some of our challenges are.” She told MPs that the department relied on StatsSA to determine their targets for grants and outreach programmes.

The department’s deputy director-general, Conny Nxumalo, said no new students would be accepted in 2018. “It just doesn’t make sense to keep training social workers if there are no funds to appoint them. Currently there are 2,784 unemployed social workers who were part of scholarship programme. This number is higher when you consider those who paid for their own studies,” she said.
