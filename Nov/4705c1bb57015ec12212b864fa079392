At 10:00 the race winners were probably already back in Kenya, and the middle of the field was a terrible thing to witness: the long dead inhabitants of a disco necropolis hurling their carcasses through time and space, pit-patting on the asphalt in mid-range Nikes, as if fleeing the rump of some disaster that’s far more terrifying than death – Vegan Day at the local cemetery; an amorous gravedigger; an Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma political rally.

To say that they owe their vastly undistinguished political careers to Jacob Zuma would be to rather understate the case, and both were in attendance, singing for their supper.

Locked in a ludicrous political equation, she loses everything by winning, and loses nothing by losing. She could easily nail herself a sinecure at the International Monetary Fund or some fancy international talk shop, buy Blahniks on 5th Avenue with her own US dollars, and remain uncontaminated by the Niehauses of the world. She’s smart enough to know that the ANC cannot further the interests of this country, just as she is likely well aware that every scheme currently promulgated – from the officially adopted National Development Plan to the free jazz improvisation of Radical Economic Transformation – is destined to smack against the wall of a nasty structural adjustment package.

As an expert with many years of experience, Niehaus has a tendency to chew the cud of journalistic circumspection with bovine truculence. “The big issue she’s been pushing is the implementation of Radical Economic Transformation policy,” he said, after a few moments’ pause. “She has a great reputation as a manager and an administrator. We have not conducted our campaign on the front pages of mainstream media, but at a grass roots level, amongst the real people of the ANC, we find a deep response to the message of RET.

And after all, they’ve been divorced for 20 years.” She’s not being dragged into the swamp, because she’s a politician in her own right,” Niehaus reminded me. “In fact, she was a minister in Cabinet in 1994 before even Zuma was a minister.

Until former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene was fired in December 2015, part of the ANC served as a front for Big Business, a political/corporate structure that deployed its cadres to all the right boards. In the process, comrades got stinking rich. Simultaneously, a second faction was intent of stripping State-owned Enterprises of as much wealth as possible in the shortest possible amount of time. In the process, other comrades got stinking rich. Both tacks were given cover by ostensibly progressive political programmes – the former under empowerment, the latter under transformation.

No one had ever anticipated a patronage network of this scale, and the people who can be counted as his dependents numbered in the hundreds. Hilariously, there are 76 Cabinet ministers and deputies, a nearly R200-million-a-year expenditure that has fried the governance mainframe. Everyone is on the take, even if they don’t know they are.

Zuma was supposed to arrive at 11. He was two hours late. Des and Nomvula hid under a small awning.

Out on the streets, the residents of Kagiso seemed not to care. The president of the republic was due to make an appearance, and there were no throngs of people, no ululating children. When the presidential motorcade finally arrived – a metal snake of 11 luxury vehicles – it looked laugh-out-loud funny in the context of a township in which no one gave a shit. When Zuma stepped out, there was finally some weary ululating. The delegation moved into the house, and the press was shoved in with him. Shortly after I entered the home, he gave me a warm smile and clasped his hands by way of greeting. This was by no means customary.  Out on the streets, the residents of Kagiso seemed not to care.

Which begged the question: where did all the cash for these shindigs come from if not from underground Mafia cronyism? This was uBaba’s first major-ish speech since the flap caused by Jacques Pauw’s new book, The President’s Keepers, which was currently doing the rounds as digital samizdat, a PDF passed from phone to phone like it was 1984. One of the more explosive revelations in the book was that NDZ’s campaign was being funded by cigarette smuggling money.

He said the international community was reluctant to support the ANC because of the congress’s unremitting support for communism. “Tambo turned toward the East for help, and they agreed to help with military training, food, accommodation, and other matters.”  Zuma wanted us to understand that we were subject to a plot so nefarious and terrible that it could only have originated in the bowels of the Cold War.

The West hated the ANC for its links with the communist east, he reminded us. Then, in the early 1990s, the communist East dismantled socialism, which meant the West had no excuse but to support the ANC. Instead, the West instructed the apartheid regime to destroy its nuclear arsenal, so that the ANC’s newly retro commies wouldn’t get their hands on the Bomb. Due to the negotiated settlement, the ANC was forced into bed with its de facto enemies. And it’s been a nightmare since then.

But there remains serious pressure from the West, who were enraged by the BRICS engagement, and sought to destroy its members. First, Russia was whacked with sanctions following its Crimean adventures. Then the Brazilian government was undone. After that, they came for the ANC, and tried to have the regime changed through the motion of no confidence vote that happened by secret ballot in August.
