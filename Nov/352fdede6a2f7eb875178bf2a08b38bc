Addressing Gardee, Phosa said: “I agree [with the EFF], he must step down.” However, if Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa took over, the red overalls would just chant “Marikana, Marikana” in Parliament, Phosa said, referring to Ramaphosa’s alleged involvement in the 2012 government massacre of 34 miners.

Phosa, who has been close to Malema ever since opposing his expulsion from the ANC in 2012, was involved in getting the ANC and the EFF to talk coalitions in August 2016, after the local elections.
