Up until then, the Russia of the Tsars was one of history’s most terrible dictatorships. The vast majority of Russians laboured under severe oppression, and were subject to the iron rule of the regime and the nobility.

Industrialisation created a new class of worker in Russia who lived in abject misery and poverty. Workers had no political rights and no means of gaining even minor reforms. Work hours were long, wages were poor and unemployment was high. The state was bankrupted by the excessive extravagance of the Tsar, expensive wars, and the burden of an impotent bureaucracy. The privileged classes of the clergy and nobility were exempt from taxes, while the poor, peasantry and working class were over-burdened with taxes. Russia's defeat in the 1905 war against Japan exacerbated the discontentment of the people. Industrialisation created a new class of worker in Russia who lived in abject misery and poverty.

On the morning of the 22 January 1905, on the back of strikes and war time strife, crowds began to gather on the bitterly cold morning at different points of St. Petersburg. Led by the charismatic priest Georgy Apollonovich Gapon, over 3,000 workers both women, men and their children peacefully marched their way over the frozen landscape to the Winter Palace to implore the Tsar to help alleviate their hardships. The Tsarist regime responded with violence and by the end of the day over 300 peaceful protesters had been killed. Bloody Sunday, as the massacre came to be known, laid the foundation for the events that took place 12 years later that would end the Tsarist regime once and for all.

Despite the institutionalisation of the Duma (a legislative body in the ruling assembly of Russia) and the limitation of the Tsarist power after the events of Bloody Sunday in 1905, the life of ordinary Russians did not improve. In 1917, fed up with the impact of the World War l, which caused major food shortages in the country, female textile workers in Saint Petersburg went on strike in March -- International Working Women’s Day. They were joined by soldiers and members of the peasantry. A few days later,Tsar Nicholas abdicated the throne ending centuries of Russian Romanov rule and the Tsarist system was permanently overthrown. The Duma formed a provisional government on March 12.

Although workers and peasants were driving the revolution, the revolutionary moment of March was quickly captured by the Mensheviks who began to push for a much more liberal programme. The power of the Bolsheviks, (who were led by Vladimir Lenin), was sidelined. Lenin was forced into exile, where he mobilised the Bolsheviks from Finland, urging them mobilise workers and insist on the power of the soviets and the council of deputies. They moved quickly and won majorities in the councils (Soviets) which sprung up in factories and workplaces everywhere. Under the simple slogan of bread, peace and land, Lenin was able to dramatically turn the tide of power.

The soviets, who sprung up in factories and workplaces everywhere, became a key sight of the power struggle. Unions mushroomed in previously unorganised industries. The soviets supervised production and became very powerful forces in the workplace. Initially the role of these committees was to monitor the bosses and to prevent them from hoarding goods or sabotaging the factory. Eventually they were responsible for the hiring and firing of workers; they secured materials, controlled production, and eventually the distribution of goods. In some larger workplaces, the committees took on demands for child care and food among workers.

The soldiers and sailors are being emancipated from the power of autocratic generals, for generals will henceforth be elective and subject to recall.

Only then can genuine social and economic equality, and therefore democracy, be achieved. The existence of mutually hostile classes which originated in the division of labour, and the division of labour as it existed under capitalism, should be abolished.

The negotiated settlement left our society unchanged: the racist colonial capitalist foundations of our economy and society remain intact. The theft of land was legalised through a bourgeoisie constitution, and the dominance of White Monopoly Capital in the economy was left unchanged and unchallenged. The cultural dominance of white people was also entrenched. This has created one of the most unequal societies in the world. Poverty levels have risen to alarming levels where more than half the population lives in abject poverty. More than a quarter of the population is unemployed, and the dignity of the majority of Africans is violated every day by poverty, unemployment and extreme inequalities. The majority of the working class is denied quality education and the only health care system available to them is an inferior and public health care system, which is more likely to maim or kill than heal you. The human personality of millions of Africans, the majority of South Africans, lies oppressed under the yolk of white supremacist domination.
