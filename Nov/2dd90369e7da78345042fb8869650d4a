Michael Komape died in a pit latrine at his school outside Polokwane in 2014. On Tuesday, day two of the trial against the state by the Komape family, the state attempted to discredit the earlier testimony of Michael’s parents, Rosina and James Komape.        Advocate Simon Phaswane for the state challenged Rosina Komape’s testimony that the Department of Education had not been forthcoming with support to the family following Michael’s death. He promised to bring witnesses who would testify that financial and other assistance, including psychological counselling and contributions to funeral expenses, were offered to the family in the days after the tragedy.

Rosina Komape conceded that there had been assistance from the department for the funeral, but said that it was insufficient for the scale of the tragedy she had just suffered, and the number of people who came to her home to offer solace in the days leading up to the funeral. Local custom required that these mourners be fed, which was paid for by the family and from donations from the community. She seemed uncertain as to what donations and how much had come from the department, though she said the food paid for by the department had been consumed by the grave diggers. She said that perhaps 1,000 people had attended the funeral, which was a huge event for the village of Chebeng, outside Polokwane, where the Komapes live.

In the afternoon, Michael’s father James took the stand, explaining that he had no permanent employment. He relies on odd jobs. He described how he had received the fateful call from the school principal on 20 January 2014 that Michael was missing. He immediately went to the school accompanied by a colleague who took photos of the pit latrines. The school authorities asked James’s colleague to delete the photos, which he did. James then asked him to take more photos and handed the phone to him. These photos were presented in court on Monday.
