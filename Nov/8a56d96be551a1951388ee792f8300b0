  1  1   1 “We wish to assure the nation that his Excellency the President of Zimbabwe and Commander in Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces Robert Mugabe and his family are safe and sound and their security is guaranteed. We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice,” army Chief of Staff, Major General SB Moyo said during an announcement on state television during the early hours of Wednesday.        “To both our people and the world beyond our borders, we wish to make it abundantly clear that this is not a military takeover of government, what the Zimbabwe Defence Forces is doing is to pacify a degenerating political, social and economic situation in our country, which if not addressed may result in violent conflict,” Moyo said. “As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy.”        Moyo, who called on all Zimbabwe Defence Force personnel currently on leave to return to barracks “with immediate effect”, said the army was targeting members of the ruling party around Mugabe, who are bent on destroying what had been fought for. But, he said, “ this is not a military takeover of government”.   1  1   1 His comments follow that of                                     But in his statement, Moyo urged ordinary Zimbabweans to remain calm and “limit unnecessary” movement but said “we encourage those who are employed and those with essential business in the city to continue their normal activities as usual”.        Locals had mixed responses to the developments, with many concerned with what the future held.         “They are fighting on their own – as long as it will not come in our homes it's fine,” said one young man.    1  1   1 “That’s the only way to a better Zimbabwe, there has to be conflict, no smooth transition will usher us to development. What do we expect if someone stays in power for the past 37 years, he is the only block to our development and democratic process,” said another.    2  2   2 From 4am, speeches from Chiwenga and Moyo have been read and military songs played on the regional broadcaster.        Reports, that Daily Maverick has been unable to independently verify, have emerged that Mugabe is negotiating for Grace to be allowed to leave the country before he steps down. In the event of that happening, the ousted Mnangagwa would act as president until the December congress.    6  6   6                    7  7   7   1  1   1      3  3   3 President Jacob Zuma, on behalf of SADC, released a statement later on Wednesday noting the situation.        Zuma called for calm and restraint and expressed “hope that developments in Zimbabwe would not lead to unconstitutional changes of Government as that would be contrary to both SADC and African Union positions”.        “The President has urged the Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe Defence Force to resolve the political impasse amicably and has urged the Zimbabwean Defence Force to ensure that the maintenance of peace and security in the country is not compromised,” the statement read.                                  2  2   2                 4  4   4          6  6   6                3  3   3 He would then become ZanuPF’s candidate for next year’s national election by which time Mugabe would also step down as national president.             3  3   3 “I think Mugabe will be told to re-appoint ED  (Mnangagwa) as VP, have him act for five minutes and then be told to hop it, with his good wife.”      4  4   4               "The main indicator of a broader outbreak of violence would be the reaction of the Presidential Guard, which remains loyal to President Mugabe."               "No one wants to see a coup... If the army takes over that will be undesirable. It will bring democracy to a halt," shadow defence minister Gift Chimanikire, told AFP on Tuesday.
