He loved everything.” He especially loved music and dancing. Jabulile said he was like that from the moment she met him. It didn’t matter what sort of music, he’d just dance. Sometimes Jabulile, Sizwe’s sister Thulisile, and two brothers, Mandla and Mpumelelo, would tease him for dancing when the music had stopped or for moving to his own rhythm.

They just treated him like a brother. He loved Thulisile deeply and was protective of his little brothers. He communicated through making sounds and hand gestures. “Once you made a mistake, he would say that you’re stupid, in a funny way,” Jabulile remembered.

He could become possessive over objects, but his siblings understood. “If you think you are going to take that remote from him, huh, you’ve got another think coming,” exclaimed Jabulile. Mostly, she remembers his joy. “Sizwe was a very friendly person.

After the cleansing ceremony in 2009, he danced in church. “Sizwe was such a loving child. We know when he comes home it would be the happiest holidays ever because we know we are going to have our entertainer,” said Jabulile.  Sizwe’s father passed away.

Sizwe spent almost 16 years at Life Esidimeni’s Waverley facility. Before Jabulile got sick, the family would visit twice a month and take him home twice a year for three weeks. He could walk, run and bathe on his own. Jabulile doesn’t know how it happened, but at Life Esidimeni he started accompanying doctors on their rounds. People started calling him “Dr Hlatshwayo”. Sometimes he would help the kitchen staff. Sizwe spent almost 16 years at Life Esidimeni’s Waverley facility.

The arbitrator, former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, said the image of the boy who liked to dance was etched in his mind. “You know, human beings are important only because they’re human beings. They don’t have to be anything else to be worthy of our regard. Nothing more than that. And every time regard goes away, the consequences are well known in human history,” he said.
