The military intervention dubbed “a coup not a coup” resulted in the ousting of the 93-year-old Robert Mugabe after a 37-year rule. Mugabe, who wanted his wife Grace Mugabe to replace him, was put under house arrest and finally resigned, paving the way for Mnangagwa, the former vice president he sacked several weeks ago.

Mugabe was often criticised for having a bloated cabinet, which had more than 40 ministers and 20 deputy ministers despite the country facing dire economic problems. He was also accused of appointing individuals who were loyal to him but not necessarily competent to hold the posts they were given.
