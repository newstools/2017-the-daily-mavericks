       The State Security Agency has opened a case against veteran investigative journalist Jacques Pauw, author of The President’s Keepers, for contravening sections of  the  National Strategic Intelligence Act.              But despite initial media reports claiming that Pauw had been charged, Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said this was not the case.         He, however confirmed that an official investigation was under way into a complaint laid regarding a contravention of the intelligence act.        On Thursday Gauteng provincial police spokesperson Col Lungelo Dlamini told TimesLive that criminal charges had been laid against Pauw. Approached for confirmation of this, Dlamini referred all queries to the Hawks.        “No charges have been laid against anyone as the Hawks are still carrying out an investigation,” Mulaudzi said.        Pauw’s book claims among other things,  that the security agency wasted over R1-billion     during a three-year period on an intelligence programme called the Principal Agent Network (PAN), that Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma's ANC presidential campaign was being funded, in part, by controversial tobacco businessman Adriano Mazzotti and that President Jacob Zuma did not pay tax for five years during his presidency. The book  was released last week with the author and the publishers receiving cease and desist letters. The letters claimed that the book was in violation of the Intelligence Services Act.        The South African Revenue Services has also indicated that it was receiving legal advice on steps (civil or criminal) it could take against Pauw  for what it claims was his unlawful divulgence of confidential taxpayer information.            “SARS views the publication of the confidential taxpayer information through Mr Pauw’s book and the Sunday Times as unlawful and a criminal offence in terms of section 236 of the Tax Administration Act,” said SARS in a press release last week.        Pauw, who also claims to have received death threats since the book was published, and his publishers have said they stand by the book's contents.        Attempts to reach Pauw or his publishers were unsuccessful on Thursday afternoon.  DM DM
