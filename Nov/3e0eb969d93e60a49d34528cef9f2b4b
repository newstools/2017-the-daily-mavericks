For example, the  For example, the  For example, the  European Psychiatry European Psychiatry European Psychiatry  paper noted that, in general, the prevalence of diabetes in schizophrenic patients is two to three-fold higher than in the general population, caused by bad diet but also by the medications used to control the disease.  paper noted that, in general, the prevalence of diabetes in schizophrenic patients is two to three-fold higher than in the general population, caused by bad diet but also by the medications used to control the disease.  paper noted that, in general, the prevalence of diabetes in schizophrenic patients is two to three-fold higher than in the general population, caused by bad diet but also by the medications used to control the disease.

Although data is limited for South Africa, the United Kingdom spends about 10 percent of its National Health System’s budget for psychiatric medications on antipsychotic drugs. Globally, they are widely used, and according to market research company BCC Research, the world spent $14.5 billion on antipsychotic medications in 2014 alone.

This makes access to nutritional assistance for mental health patients all the more important. In South Africa’s public-sector dieticians are a low priority on the mental health agenda, but private psychiatric institutions often do facilitate sessions with nutrition health professionals.

The links between these illnesses are complex, but even if sugar is not technically an addictive substance, many people consume it compulsively, similar to the way an addict would behave with narcotic substances, according to Charlene McIntosh a psychologist based at Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital in Durban.

Mandy Read, a private dietician also at Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital, works with obese patients preparing them for gastric bypass surgery: a weight-loss operation in which the stomach is split into two pouches and the small intestine is re-connected to both. It limits the amount of food a patient can ingest, causing them to lose weight and, in some cases, it reverses diabetes disease.
