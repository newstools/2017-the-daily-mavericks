       Newly appointed Police Commissioner Khehla John Sitole is career police officer who is said to be a man of integrity who could restore stability to the top ranks of the SAPS. He has largely avoided public scandal and even while occupying top police positions remained in the background, leaving some unsure of what to make of his appointment.

Zuma announced on Wednesday afternoon that he had given the job to Sitole, who will take over from acting commissioner Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba, who replaced acting commissioner Lieutenant-General Kgomotso Phahlane only six months ago. He is the first police commissioner to be appointed permanently since Riah Phiyega was suspended in 2015.

Unlike the last three former permanent police commissioners, Phiyega, Bheki Cele and Jackie Selebi, who were all appointed from outside SAPS and became beset by scandal, Sitole worked his way through the ranks to become Free State provincial commissioner in 2011, deputy national commissioner of policing in 2013, and national divisional commissioner of protection and security services in 2016.

Portfolio Committee on Policing chairperson Francois Beukman welcomed the appointment of a career policeman. He has interacted with Sitole in Parliament. “In our interactions with him he’s a straightforward and down to earth person,” he said. “I think we’ve got to expect he will be able to deal with the issues in the policing environment.” Portfolio Committee on Policing chairperson Francois Beukman welcomed the appointment of a career policeman.

Burger said Sitole’s anonymity made him a surprising candidate, although he had been mentioned as a possible replacement to Phiyega in 2015. Acting police boss Mothiba could have been given the top job to help him take back some of the responsibility he seems to have given to Police Minister Fikile Mbalula. Deputy Commissioner Lieutenant-General Gary Kruser had the experience and political history, he said. Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi showed he would not bow to political pressure during his brief acting stint as commissioner from 2011.

Democratic Alliance (DA) shadow minister of policing Zakhele Mbhele said Sitole was not the best candidate for the job and could buckle if Zuma applied political pressure. “While we acknowledge that General Sitole is an improvement from his predecessor because he is an experienced and senior career officer, we are not convinced that he has the backbone to resist political pressure on the SAPS,” he said in a statement.

Sitole was head of the police’s protection and security services when Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma was granted SAPS VIP protection after she returned to South Africa when her term as African Union Commission chairperson ended.

Burger and Beukman were clear on what Sitole should prioritise after his immediate appointment. Burger said he needs to restore public confidence in the police and create stability after the restructuring of the top brass multiple times in recent years. He should take a strong position on corruption and lead a disciplinary hearing against suspended crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli, who has been on paid suspension for six years as he faces criminal charges.

Contacted shortly after the announcement, Popcru General Secretary Nkosinathi Theledi said he had not expected the appointment. Later, the union’s spokesperson Richard Mamabolo said the union’s position on Sitole would depend on his vision. “We think it would be important that structures within the SAPS, both nationally and provincially, are formalised, since there is no formal structure. We need to deal away with the bloating of managerial personnel at the HQ and provinces, with more support on the ground.” Contacted shortly after the announcement, Popcru General Secretary Nkosinathi Theledi said he had not expected the appointment.

That didn’t happen, but perhaps the president was influenced by the growing calls to appoint a commissioner with policing experience.
