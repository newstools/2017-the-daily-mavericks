For a climate regime that depends on global support, Fiji as the upcoming COP23 chair must focus on maintaining momentum and ensuring that commitments are delivered under the existing Paris Agreement. In some ways the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has galvanised commitment to it. First, the international coalition forged to deliver the Paris Agreement has strengthened, with other G-7 countries, the G20, the EU, China and India all issuing strong statements on their continuing commitment to the existing targets. Second, there has been a broad-based domestic response in support of the Paris Agreement with individual states, cities, businesses, and other entities attempting to take independent steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. California, Washington, and New York, through the US Climate Alliance, have committed to support the achievement of the US national target of 26%-28% below 2005 emission levels by 2025. Despite this welcomed leadership, these commitments will be difficult to achieve without federal regulatory or legislative action.

As the first small island developing country to host the negotiations, Fiji also intends to represent the voices of the most vulnerable low-lying coastal and islands states. Many island states and least developed economies seek clarity on the mobilisation of funding to support the loss and damage impacts of climate change and climate risk management. Coincidentally, these discussions take place against a backdrop of a distressing period of extreme weather events globally.
