       Donald Trump’s seemingly improbable election sullied many reputations, but perhaps none more so devastatingly than those of professional pollsters and the Democratic establishment. With the first anniversary of the Narcissist-in-Chief’s ascent coinciding almost perfectly with state-wide elections in purple Virginia, blue donkeys and opinion diviners sought mutual vindication.

Throughout the campaign pollsters predicted a close, but clear, victory for Northam. Their bet seemed an obvious one: Hillary Clinton had carried the state by five percentage points in last year’s presidential palaver; Democrats had won three of the last four governor’s races; and Democratic Party representatives dominated state-wide elected office, holding both of the state’s seats in the US Senate, the office of Attorney General, and Northam’s Lieutenant Governorship.

Gillespie initially put out a GOP campaign from the days of Reagan/Bush yore: cut taxes, inevitably boost the economy, government is bad and must be eviscerated… yada yada. Failing to stoke any fire in the belly of the Republican base, Gillespie went full American carnage in the final weeks of the campaign, running a relentless series of ads predicting that a Northam victory would usher in hellfire at the hands of child molesters and MS13 Salvadorian gangsters, and the wholesale destruction of “our” heritage (a dog-whistle for Confederate memorials and white supremacy).

Further down the ballot, liberal voters brought their own carnage to long-standing Republican strongholds: Justin Fairfax, candidate for Lieutenant Governor, became only the second African-American to win state-wide office in a state where white supremacists gathered just months ago chanting “you will not replace us”; Danica Roem, a 33-year-old former journalist, displaced 13-term incumbent and self-styled “homophobe in chief”, Robert G Marshall, and in so doing became the first openly transgender candidate to be elected to office in the US; and Hala Ayala and Elizabeth Guzman – the latter an immigrant from Peru – made history as the first Latin candidates elected to the Virginia state house, both unseating GOP incumbents in the process.

Virginia was not the only good news Democrats received on the night. Phil Murphy pummelled the Republican incumbent Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno for the right to succeed Chris Christie as Governor of New Jersey.

To cap it all, two districts deep in the north-east, politically crimson hinterland of Georgia incomprehensively swung blue.  Virginia was not the only good news Democrats received on the night.
