This is becoming evident every day. Her victory at the conference will clearly upset a few ANC branches and members, but that’s in the realm of party democracy; however, it will highly antagonise the politico-media complex, who have all but called for defeat come December 2017.

This expose is contained in a sensational new book published on Sunday. All good so far. So who is the author of this book with such explosive revelations? It turns out, it’s Jacques Pauw himself.
