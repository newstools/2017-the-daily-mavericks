       TGIF, 17 November 2017        “If some lives form a perfect circle, others take shape in ways we cannot predict or always understand. Loss has been part of my journey. But it has also shown me what is precious. So has love for which I can only be grateful.” Nicholas Sparks          STORY OF THE DAY               By CARIEN DU PLESSIS By CARIEN DU PLESSIS          1  1   1                                                             IN NUMBERS        10 10               FACTS OF THE DAY                          FEATURED ARTICLES   2  2   2 State Capture: HSBC continues to investigate its links to Gupta family        BY MARIANNE THAMM BY MARIANNE THAMM        DA’s 2019 Gauteng ambitions divide party ahead of provincial election        BY GREG NICOLSON BY GREG NICOLSON        Zimbabwe: Mugabe’s exit strategy on the high-level negotiation table        BY PETER FABRICIUS BY PETER FABRICIUS        Harare: Business as usual (Photo Essay)        BY SHAUN SWINGLER BY SHAUN SWINGLER        AfriForum’s private prosecution plan under way with Jiba in sights        BY REBECCA DAVIS BY REBECCA DAVIS        Op-Ed: Eskom’s sales, revenue and debtor management challenges        BY C YELLAND & Y GROENEWALD BY C YELLAND & Y GROENEWALD        Parliamentary Reporter’s Notebook: Furore erupts over audit report undermining Gengezi Mgidlana’s disciplinary        BY MARIANNE MERTEN BY MARIANNE MERTEN        Zimbabwe: No point in military intervention if Mugabe retains power – human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa        BY SALLY NYAKANYANGA BY SALLY NYAKANYANGA        Reporter’s Sporting Weekend Notebook: A week of epic World Cup fails        BY ANTOINETTE MULLER BY ANTOINETTE MULLER        Water Crisis: City of Cape Town reveals plan for 200 distribution points in the event of ‘Day Zero’        BY AYANDA CHARLIE AND LEILA DOUGAN BY AYANDA CHARLIE AND LEILA DOUGAN        OPINIONISTAS        The Other News Round-Up: Paranoia Will Destroy Ya        A column by MARELISE VAN DER MERWE A column by MARELISE VAN DER MERWE   MARELISE VAN DER MERWE        Hostility towards any section of society is a betrayal of the ANC character        A column by DAVID KA-NDYALVAN A column by DAVID KA-NDYALVAN   DAVID KA-NDYALVAN        Are South African health workers being silenced into malpractice?
