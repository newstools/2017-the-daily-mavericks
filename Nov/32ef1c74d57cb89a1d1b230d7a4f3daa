In Henri van Breda’s account, his family was set upon by at least two intruders – masked, black, and Afrikaans-speaking – who entered their Stellenbosch home without detection and proceeded to slaughter father Martin, mother Teresa, brother Rudi, and leave sister Marli for dead. That they barely harmed Henri is something he cannot explain.

Upon accessing the house, their presence failed to wake any family members or disturb the family dog Sasha, who was known to bark loudly when one of the family’s two domestic workers entered.

Despite the fact that the home was stocked with top-of-the-range electronic equipment – including a brand new sound system – the intruders chose to steal nothing. They left the home and the estate the way they entered: without a trace. In Van Breda’s account, one of the intruders laughed loudly throughout the attack, like a bad guy in a movie.

Van Breda coolly conceded on the stand on Tuesday that his family had no known enemies; nobody who could be said to bear a grudge against them. His uncle had previously testified similarly. His father, Martin van Breda, was the director of at least 25 companies – mostly in property and education – but all of them seemingly of unimpeachable repute. The court heard that Van Breda senior experienced no bad blood with colleagues or business partners.

The latest crime statistics, delivered by police last week, make it clear that the fear of ordinary South Africans of being attacked in their homes is well-founded. The possibility that a South African’s life may end in murder is plausible – particularly if you are poor, black, or living in an isolated rural area.

Henri van Breda testified on Tuesday that after his family returned to South Africa after some years in Australia, “the intention was always to stay in a secure estate somewhere in Cape Town”. They found that apparent haven in the De Zalze estate in Stellenbosch: a complex equipped with a perimeter alarm system, electric fences, CCTV monitoring, dog patrols and strict visitor registration processes.

Van Breda told the court of summers spent boating and skiing. Their home was serviced daily by two domestic workers on alternating shifts. Henri van Breda was planning to spend 2015 on a “gap year” from his studies in physics, intending to undertake a diving course in KwaZulu-Natal recommended by a cousin.

Van Breda said that the family felt so comfortable in their environment that it was routine for them to leave the back door unlocked, as they had on the night of the murders.        These idyllic lives were shattered, in Van Breda’s telling, by the seemingly motiveless violence of black South Africans. It is a dark sign of the times that two of the factors that have caused public suspicion to rest upon Henri are the fact that none of the family’s possessions were stolen, and neither of the two women present was sexually assaulted. Had either of these two additional crimes taken place, the plausibility of Henri’s story would probably be heightened in the public imagination.

This is the case even in the absence of a clear motive for Van Breda’s own possible commission of the crimes. A vast inheritance; a controlling father; a goody-two-shoes brother with whom Henri had been in unending competition – all these possible explanations have been raised around braais and water coolers, at dinner parties and in taxis, without any firm evidence to support such scenarios.

The proving of motive is not necessary for a verdict in criminal law, however. Even those who firmly believe that Oscar Pistorius intentionally murdered Reeva Steenkamp would have to concede that no watertight story was presented to the court in that case to explain what drove such a terrible impulse. If Henri van Breda is found guilty, it may similarly be in the absence of any firm rationale for the crimes. The proving of motive is not necessary for a verdict in criminal law, however.

Either Henri van Breda murdered his family in a fit of psychopathic violence, or he is the victim of a crime of almost unimaginable randomness and atrocity. The terrible reality about South Africa is that either scenario could, ultimately, be true. We’ve seen both these movies before: the one where a man – always a man – explodes in the ultimate manifestation of rage and entitlement; and the one where lives are taken by strangers in an act of motiveless evil.
