The case is about the drowning of Michael Komape, aged five, in a school pit toilet in Chebeng Village outside Polokwane.        The Komape family is suing the state for roughly R3-million in damages. The state has already conceded liability, so the trial is about determining the extent of damages it will have to pay. Some of the smaller damage amounts were agreed between the parties at the end of Friday’s proceedings and were made an order of court.
