Matjila and Gigaba have both denied that this was the case. Matjila’s reported resistance led to an internal investigation, which cleared him of the allegations laid.

He emphasised that the PIC makes investment decisions based on the GEPF’s aim of growing government employees’ retirement savings, as well as other social and economic imperatives. “What I want to stress is that there’s very little influence from Treasury.” On Tuesday, the PIC and GEPF tried to allay fears that workers’ retirement savings would be wasted. “The mandate [to the PIC] is clear.

The reports said the funds from the PIC could be used to prop up SAA, Eskom, PetroSA and Denel, all of which have featured in stories on State Capture, alleging corrupt contracts have been given to the Gupta family and other intermediaries.

After recent concern that he might be removed as head of the PIC, Matjila said, “All I can say is that I’m still at the PIC. The board had to do what it had to do.” He said he trusts statements from the board and Gigaba endorsing his leadership are genuine. “I’m okay.

Matjila said the PIC might continue to invest in companies such as Eskom and SAA, but only if it was confident they would deliver profits. He said the PIC needed to change the way it operated, having a much stronger influence in how State-owned Entities operate.

It will probably include increasing exposure to international markets – currently only 5% of funds are invested abroad – as well as further investing in unlisted assets. The planned move follows the poor performance of South Africa’s economy. The GEPF is looking at modifying how it uses workers’ retirement savings by developing a new strategic allocation model.
