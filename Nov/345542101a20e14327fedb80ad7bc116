At most stations the RRP officers are deployed outside the station and only a few PRASA Officers are on the platforms. This makes it very difficult to prevent people from entering the station illegally, as well as to ensure safe boarding and alighting when trains arrive. There is also inadequate protection for train drivers who are threatened and intimidated by commuters,” stated the report.
