The South African Department of Trade and Industry released its draft intellectual property policy in August, which proposes changes to intellectual property law that could improve access to treatments for illnesses such as cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, mental health conditions, hepatitis and epilepsy. Currently, many patients cannot access treatments due to prices inflated by the country’s patent laws.
