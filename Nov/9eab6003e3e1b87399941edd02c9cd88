       Things are not where they should be,” admitted ANN7 and The New Age boss Mzwanele Manyi at The Gathering in Sandton on Thursday while in debate with The President’s Keepers author Jacques Pauw and economist Iraj Abedian. That was the only admission he was willing to make on the current government’s contribution to South Africa’s challenges. He added: “It would be very superficial to characterise this as a President Zuma issue.” Things are not where they should be,” admitted ANN7 and The New Age boss Mzwanele Manyi at The Gathering in Sandton on Thursday while in debate with The President’s Keepers author Jacques Pauw and economist Iraj Abedian.

Abedian spoke on the economy. Manyi did Manyi. Abedian went first.        It seems to me in almost eight years we have undermined the structure of our economy and we’re doing it here daily. We see ministers do it. We see businesses doing it. We see lawyers doing it. We see accountants doing it,” opened Abedian, saying it will take years to fix. “We are not paying attention to our economy.” He said words like “auditor” and “minister” are no longer respected and as society’s fundamental values are destroyed, so is the economy.

Manyi jumped in. Three ANC presidential candidates withdrew from the event this week. Manyi said it was a problem that the ANC was not represented and claimed that invitations to ANC candidates need to go through Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe’s office. Then he took the conversation back to democracy’s foundations.  Manyi jumped in. Three ANC presidential candidates withdrew from the event this week.

If you’re a black business person in this country, the policies are not favouring you. They favour the entrenched white minority capital,” Manyi continued, calling President Jacob Zuma a “saviour” for pursuing radical economic transformation. The compromises agreed to at Codesa are often criticised for causing the country’s current failures, but Manyi, whose company Lodidox recently took over ANN7 and The New Age from the Gupta family, used the issues to deflect rather than reflect.

It used to have five investigative units targeting crime syndicates and big business but amid false claims of a “rogue unit” Commissioner Tom Moyane closed all five. “Those investigations are dead,” he said. “We must have the only revenue service in the world that doesn’t have an investigative capacity.”  He used the example of SARS.

He wouldn’t lay the sole blame on Zuma, but said there are no investigations because institutions have been hollowed out by Zuma and his allies.

On multiple occasions, he accused his fellow panellists of being selective and hypocritical in their criticism. He claimed there was a rogue unit – Pauw assured him there was not – and said the government in the early ‘90s set the country’s financial policies on the wrong course, especially with the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA).

Abedian tried to reason with Manyi and said we must fight white minority capital and corrupt corporates, but cannot allow others to loot the state in the meantime (the Gupta family wasn’t touched on).

Out of his depth on facts, Manyi reverted to slogans as he continued to criticise Zuma’s critics and stuck to his thesis: “People talk about capture where in fact the biggest capture happened in 1994.”  Out of his depth on facts, Manyi reverted to slogans as he continued to criticise Zuma’s critics and stuck to his thesis: “People talk about capture where in fact the biggest capture happened in 1994.”         Like all populists, some of his points resonate. But like many state institutions, he proved hollow, symbolising levels of debate in some quarters. Like all populists, some of his points resonate.
