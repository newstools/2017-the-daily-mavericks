During question time, Maimane faced tough questions on the perception that the DA is a white party. He said 63% of the DA’s public representatives are black and the party caucus in the National Assembly will be more diverse after the 2019 elections. “You can’t change it midstream.” During question time, Maimane faced tough questions on the perception that the DA is a white party.
