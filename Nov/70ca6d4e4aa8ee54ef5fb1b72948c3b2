Party rules and convention dictate that those with ambition should do their best not to show it. In line with this, the two leading contenders have been fairly modest: addressing mini-rallies and “cadre forums” arranged by the party and alliance structures, but at the same time not showing too much eagerness by limiting media interviews where they could be quizzed about their ambitions and ability. Last week, three candidates cancelled their date at The Gathering at the last moment, while 702’s Eusebius McKaiser raged on social media after he got the cold shoulder from Dlamini Zuma, whose interview was scheduled for Monday.

There are more guidelines, including that a leader “should have the conviction to state his/her views boldly and openly within the constitutional structures of the movement” (which does not necessarily mean “in public”) and “not to cower before those in more senior positions in pursuit of patronage, nor rely on cliques to maintain one’s position” – at least that is the ideal.

Although it is unlikely that the party would engage the Democratic Alliance on this, this opposition party has in the past created opportunities and platforms for leaders to state their positions.

She's pretty much had her share of reporting on South African politics, attending gatherings and attracting trolls, but still finds herself attracted to it like a moth to a veld fire.  Her ultimate ambition in life is to become a travelling chocolate writer of international fame.
