The fifth day of the disciplinary hearing of suspended acting Eskom Group CEO and head of generation, Matshela Koko, got off to a very slow start on a wet, cold Saturday morning on 25 November 2017.        The day commenced with a continuation of the inconclusive evidence of Allison Seckle, Eskom’s manager of governance and acting manager of ethics. This was followed by the further inconclusive and somewhat forgetful testimony of Ayanda Noah, Eskom’s executive for customer services.

This was followed by the further inconclusive and somewhat forgetful testimony of Ayanda Noah, Eskom’s executive for customer services.         Noah’s testimony related to a R1.1-billion cabling contract at Kusile power station that was intended to be placed with Eskom subsidiary, Rotek. However, after some irregular shenanigans by Koko at Eskom’s Board Tender Committee, the contract with Rotek was blocked and instead eventually placed with ABB South Africa.

Eskom could have insisted that its employees – including those suspended – give evidence, but apparently chose not to. There is little doubt that the affidavit orchestrated by Koko and his legal team was intended to have a chilling effect on both Eskom and its witnesses about the dirt that would be revealed.

Suspended Eskom executive Abram Masango has since indicated, in an email from his lawyers at 23:00 on 24 November 2017, that he had been willing to give evidence against Koko at the disciplinary hearing prior to his “engineered, baseless and unfounded suspension” by Eskom, and that “he takes a strong stance against corruption, nepotism, flouting good corporate governance, mismanagement, abuse of power, and disregarding the PFMA and the Constitution”.

One can have empathy for Advocate Cassim Moosa in acting for a severely compromised Eskom. He had to pick up the pieces after the appalling performance of his predecessor, attorney Sebetja Matsaung. The services of Matsaung were summarily terminated by Eskom halfway through the proceedings for threatening Financial Mail deputy editor Sikonathi Mantshantsha physically at the disciplinary hearing.

Moosa seems genuinely disturbed that his witnesses had failed or refused to come forward to testify, despite taking every reasonable effort that would be expected of him as evidence leader for Eskom. He was justifiably concerned that his professional integrity and reputation may be compromised by negative media and public perceptions of the process under his watch.

However, whether he actually returns to Eskom as acting group CEO and/or head of generation remains to be seen.

The final outcome of Koko’s disciplinary hearing, expected by about 10 December 2017, may simply be a precursor to a massive settlement and golden handshake to Koko to see the back of him. However, if Koko does return, and a new, strong, credible board chairperson, board and executive management is not in place at Eskom soon, one may expect further trouble ahead.
