The proposed 9.6 GW nuclear new-build programme, so dear to the heart of President Zuma and his new energy minister, threatens what remains of South Africa’s economy, with the country’s financial position and credit rating hanging in the balance.

The long outstanding integrated energy plan (IEP) and integrated resource plan for electricity (IRP) are expected to be finalised shortly without following due process, with widespread expectations that political interference will artificially constrain renewable energy to force nuclear power into the energy mix.

Techno-economic modelling of various scenarios for the new IRP by National Treasury, the CSIR, the DoE and its IPP Office, the Energy Intensive User Group and Eskom itself, for the years to 2050, has shown conclusively that without such artificial constraints, any new nuclear and new coal generation capacity beyond Medupi and Kusile is simply not required.

In fact, scenarios constraining renewable energy to force new coal and nuclear into the mix result in a significantly higher electricity price trajectory and associated costs to the whole economy in the years to 2050, with significantly worse socio-economic benefits in respect of CO2 emissions, job creation and water use.

In the meantime, an application by Eskom for an increase in electricity tariffs is before the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) and undergoing public consultation at this time, which would result in a 20% price increase for Eskom’s direct end-customers on 1 April 2018, and a 27% increase for municipal redistributors on 1 July 2018.

There are also three deferred Eskom regulatory clearing account (RCA) applications of some R20-billion for each of Eskom’s 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17 financial years (total R60-billion) that Nersa still has to process. If granted for recovery over three years, this would result in a further electricity price increase of 10% per year for three years.

This has halted the R130-billion of private sector investment, the localisation of manufacture and the socio-economic and enterprise developments that have been achieved to date for the renewable energy projects in Bid Windows 1, 2 and 3, and delayed some R65-billion of further investment for projects in Bid Windows 3.5 and 4.

The suggestion that the REIPPP programme is somehow responsible for Eskom’s financial woes and surplus capacity is clearly spurious misinformation intended to deflect attention from the real issues of Eskom’s poor governance, financial mismanagement, spiralling costs and inefficiency.

Finally, on 1 September 2017, after years of delay and several broken deadlines, the energy minister at the time, Mmamoloko Kubayi, announced that power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 28 wind, solar PV and CSP renewable energy projects for about 2,400 MW under the REIPPP Bid Windows 3.5 and 4 programme would be signed by the end of October 2017.

However, this would be on the proviso agreed to between the DoE and Eskom that the previously announced successful REIPPP bids would be renegotiated to below R0.77/kWh for all technologies, and that the BEE shareholdings of the successful bidders would be suitably adjusted.

The opportunity for significant price adjustments and changes in the socio-economic development shareholdings from local community trusts to black industrialists raised perceptions of illegality, lack of due process, corruption and nepotism in a process previously widely acclaimed for its transparency and integrity.

However, the legal and debt financing issues remained unresolved, and the end of October 2017 came and went without a single one of the 28 PPAs under REIPPP Bid Windows 3.5 and 4 being signed.

In the interim, the DoE and its IPP Office obtained legal opinion which confirmed the unlawfulness of what was being considered. The legal view indicated that while there was some limited scope for bid negotiation in respect of value for money, an announced successful bidder could not be excluded through such renegotiation.

This confirmed Eskom’s own legal position as detailed in Section 5 of Eskom’s sworn affidavit to the Pretoria High Court on 22 September 2017 accepting its obligation to conclude PPAs in terms of the REIPPP process, and that Eskom was bound by such determinations and procurements.

The problem now is that there is no indication whatsoever that Eskom has sought or obtained any authority from its dysfunctional board to conclude PPAs with the successful Round 3.5 and 4 IPPs above R0,77/kWh, despite acknowledging its legal obligation in this regard.

Electricity customers would benefit from the lower prices of Bid Window 4.5 or a new procurement process. However, this will need to be carefully weighed against damage to investor confidence and the reputational damage to South Africa that unilateral changes to a legally binding public procurement process would undoubtedly cause.

In the meantime, the new coal IPP programme, in which two coal IPPs (Khanyisa and Thabametsi) have been announced as the successful bidders, and well as the gas-to-power procurement programme, is now also stalled pending a full review following the completion and publishing of the IEP and the updated new IRP, expected in early 2018.
