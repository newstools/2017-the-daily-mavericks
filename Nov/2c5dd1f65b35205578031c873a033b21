Every day we wake to news of sexual violence, brutal murders and the continued dehumanisation of fellow queers. We have inherited and continue to nurture a culture that normalises violence in such a way that we barely bat an eye when vulnerable members of society are subjected to structural, physical and sexual violence and continue to be stripped of their dignity. And the prevalence of hate crimes across the continent is telling of this violence inflicted upon queers.
