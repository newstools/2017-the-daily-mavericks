On Tuesday, it was the now-deceased Frankel’s darker legacy that brought lawyers and judges to the Constitutional Court. Frankel is accused of having sexually assaulted eight children aged between six and 15 between 1970 and 1989. While criminal charges can no longer be brought against him, the case is likely to cause a critical change to law: allowing for sexual offences to be prosecuted if more than 20 years have passed since the crime was committed.

This has not been the case for all old sexual offences: if the crime in question was human trafficking, rape, or using children or the mentally disabled for pornography, it could still be prosecuted. The fact that there is no legal “expiry date” on rape, for example, is what would allow singer Jennifer Ferguson to bring charges against football boss Danny Jordaan more than 20 years after the fact.

One of the important factors that the High Court took into consideration was that it is more common for people to disclose child sexual abuse when they are adults rather than children – by which point, much time may have passed. The High Court considered a report by researchers Karen Muller and Karen Hollely which noted that reasons for a child being reluctant to speak out about sexual abuse at the time of the crime may include fear of the perpetrator, or feelings of loyalty towards the perpetrator. If the victims are male, the report stated, there are “additional unique barriers”, such as social shame.

In June the judge found that the notion of treating sexual assault as less severe than rape was outdated and patriarchal, given that trauma as a result of non-penetrative sexual offences may be just as severe.

The June High Court ruling also determined that prosecutions should be able to take place 20 years or more later in cases involving adults as well as children. Stated Judge Clare Hartford: “There appears to me to be no reason why these same traumatic symptoms and pressures would not apply equally to persons who are not children at the time of the commission of the offences.” The June High Court ruling also determined that prosecutions should be able to take place 20 years or more later in cases involving adults as well as children.

Justice Minister Michael Masutha has opposed this, asking instead for more time – 24 months instead of 18 – for Parliament to do its business.

The reason given by the state in its heads of argument for wanting Parliament to be given time to amend the legislation is due to concerns over the perception that the judiciary might seem to be overriding the legislature: in other words, encroaching on the separation of powers.

Successful prosecutions for crimes committed so long ago may also be hard to achieve. Challenges here would include the loss or decay of forensic evidence, and the fallibility of witnesses’ memories after many years.
