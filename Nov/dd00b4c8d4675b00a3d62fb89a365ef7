       Almost two thirds of global TB cases occur in India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa, noted the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) annual report. TB remains the leading infectious disease killer worldwide, and is the single biggest killer of South Africans.

Tackling TB in South Africa has become a global concern, particularly in the light of our big HIV epidemic, which predisposes people to TB, and increasing rates of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB).

Tackling TB in South Africa has become a global concern, particularly in the light of our big HIV epidemic, which predisposes people to TB, and increasing rates of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB).        South Africans are at especially high risk of developing TB because most of us are already infected with the latent TB bacteria. Healthy immune systems can contain the TB bacteria, but immune-compromised individuals – such as those with HIV, diabetes or cancer – are at a higher risk.

At present, although all TB treatment is free, poor families have to shoulder high transport costs for frequent trips to health facilities.

But Dr Norbert Njeka, head of DR-TB at the Department of Health, says that scaling up access to one new drug in particular, bedaquiline, has “saved lives”. The drug, developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is the first new anti-TB drug on the market in over 50 years and has shown the most promise for treating DR-TB patients.

But results on the drug’s efficacy, presented at the recent Union Conference in Mexico, left some disappointed. Just over 83% of patients on delamanid responded to treatment within six months in comparison to 78% of patients on conventional treatment, according to research by Japanese pharmaceutical company Otsuka.

Delamanid is still regarded as a much-needed addition for TB clinicians who lack options when treating drug-resistant patients. Delamanid is being used to treat DR-TB largely in special research-based programmes but, according to MSF, only slightly more than 600 patients have received the drug worldwide to date.

He said South Africa had missed many prevention opportunities, particularly for children. For example, medication is available to prevent TB infection from developing into active illness and this can be taken for between 12 months and three years. Although all children under the age of five who have been exposed to anyone with TB qualify for this treatment in South Africa, regardless if they test positive or not, few actually get it.
