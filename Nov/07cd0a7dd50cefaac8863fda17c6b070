  3  3   3 Zimbabwe’s speaker of parliament, Jacob Mudenda, announced on Tuesday that he had received Robert Mugabe’s resignation.   7  7   7 Mugabe was swept from power as his autocratic rule crumbled within days of a military takeover.   6  6   6   16  16   16 The bombshell news was delivered to a special joint session of parliament  by the Minister of Justice and former head of the central intelligence organisation, Happyton Bonyongwe.   5  5   5   4  4   4   6  6   6        “The speaker will make sure that the proper legal processes are put in place so that the country can proceed forward with a president in place and this will be done before end of day,” Mudenda said, speaking during the parliament’s scheduled debate of a motion to impeach Mugabe.   3  3   3 Mugabe had been under pressure to resign after the military took over on Monday last week, in an operation termed “restore legacy”.   4  4   4 The army put Mugabe under a form of house arrest, only allowing him to leave depending on the destination.   4  4   4 Mugabe’s own party, Zanu-PF, fired him on Sunday as first secretary and president.        It brings an end to his 37 years of power.   6  6   6 Mugabe’s ally, Saviour Kasukuwere, tweeted earlier indicating that Bob’s rule had come to an end amid reports he had fled to Mozambique.   6  6   6 Kasukuwere thanked Mugabe, and urged unity and peace, as well as acceptance for a new dispensation, presumptively led by the new Zanu-PF president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.         Mugabe had ruled Zimbabwe almost unopposed since the country won independence from Britain in 1980.          7  7   7 It is likely that the speaker of parliament will become the acting President between now and elections scheduled for next year.
