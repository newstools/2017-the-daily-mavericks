       Tax Ombud Judge Bernard Ngoepe found “systemic” problems in SARS that allowed the taxman to unduly delay the payment of verified refunds to taxpayers, the Office of the Tax Ombud revealed in an investigative report published in September. The report was damning. The investigation came on the back of a sudden avalanche of public complaints, claiming that SARS has been grasping at every straw in order not to pay out tax refunds. Between November 2016 and March 2017, the Office of the Tax Ombud received about 500 complaints – a remarkable increase since the inception of the office in 2013. All the complaints since inception have been considered, the report notes.

Said SARS to the Tax Ombud: “Given the total universe of refund-related complaints compared to the total volume of refunds processed, the number of complaints represents less than 1% of the refunds SARS processed over the same period. Without explaining this broader context, and providing statistics that contextualise that delays occur within less than 1% of cases processed the overwhelming impression is that the findings apply to every refund processed by SARS, whereas this is far from the case.” Said SARS to the Tax Ombud: “Given the total universe of refund-related complaints compared to the total volume of refunds processed, the number of complaints represents less than 1% of the refunds SARS processed over the same period.

So naturally, the Tax Ombud whose job it is to referee the relationship between the tax payer and the taxman was not impressed.
