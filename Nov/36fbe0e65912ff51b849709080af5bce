As expected, the immediate reaction was a knee-jerk emotional one with everything from the Guptas (people give these guys way too much credit sometimes) to the media being mean about the country being in a bit of a state being fingered as the culprits.

But, if sport mirrors life, then let the irony of those calling for an open ballot with World Cup host votes possibly being the same as asking for secret ballots to remove President Jacob Zuma not be lost on anyone. We are nothing but a smorgasbord of delicious irony.

In the aftermath, many tears will be cried over just how “unifying” hosting global show-pieces can be and how it’s ever-so-good for country morale. But is it really? Does a kid living in a shack, wondering whether they might get a meal tonight really give two toots about Georgia playing Romania in a Rugby World Cup match and all the window dressing gees?

No amount of goose bump manufactured patriotism can gloss over that. Yes, hosting big events is great.

And then there is that prickly issue of transformation. Is six years really enough to fix the gross disparities in pathways to excellence for kids from suburbs and kids from townships? Unlikely. While the demographic of the national sports teams will gradually improve, these systems – hundreds of years old and largely upheld by the status quo – cannot be suddenly dismantled just because everyone has caught a bit of gees. Truth is, if South Africa were awarded the World Cup, the demographics of that 2023 might have looked a bit more representative, but that would have been in spite of the system – not because of it.
