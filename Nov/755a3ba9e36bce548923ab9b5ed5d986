The question of how a tax revolt would work has been exhaustively discussed in forums like the Tax Revolt Facebook group. Two obvious obstacles would be that individual employees have no ability to withhold PAYE from the taxman, and individual consumers no ability to avoid VAT. One suggestion has been the withholding of municipal rates and taxes, and the refusal to pay small levies like e-tolls and TV licences.

Yet it is also the case that it is overwhelmingly personal income taxpayers who are not coughing up as expected. This is demonstrated by the fact that the largest part of the current SARS deficit – almost R21-billion – is from individuals. By comparison, companies have failed to pay R4.8-billion of what was expected. Yet it is also the case that it is overwhelmingly personal income taxpayers who are not coughing up as expected.
