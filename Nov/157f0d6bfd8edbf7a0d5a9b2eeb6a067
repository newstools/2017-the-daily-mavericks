       The zinc roofs of farmworkers’ homes in the eastern Free State are peppered with stones to keep them from blowing away. No one wants to risk screwing their zinc down because they could be evicted at any moment.

But I was tired of moving,” says Chaka, who risked his life savings on building a house and screwing down the zinc roof. How do you build a house when the land doesn’t belong to you?

I was always working for other people, planting and harvesting, but this food was not accessible to us. Mielie-meal was our main diet, and milk from our cattle. We did not really eat vegetables, maybe some wild morogo (spinach) every now and then. People had lots of sicknesses because we were not eating healthily.” I was always working for other people, planting and harvesting, but this food was not accessible to us.

None of us expected the challenges of today – of mass hunger, socio-economic injustice and unemployment,” says Naidoo quietly. “We are two decades into democracy, where changing the apartheid system was hailed as a transformation miracle. But there has been insufficient change in the realities of the majority of the people. There is mass unemployment, very poor quality of schools. White farmers still load black workers on the backs of their bakkies and pay them R50 a day.

Twenty-eight hectares is being cultivated, while the rest is being used to graze cattle, and for small businesses and homesteads. Profits from farming, the lodge, a brick-making enterprise and bakery are being ploughed back into the community.

Nonetheless, they have resolved to keep their land free from chemicals and pesticides to grow the healthiest crops possible. In addition, they are growing diverse crops to ensure they have a balanced diet, building seed banks and re-introducing medicinal plants to the farm.

There has been a coup d’état on our plates, explains Naidoo. “Many families in South Africa face the double burden of malnourishment and obesity. The fast food industry is poisoning us. We have an explosion of diseases that never faced us in the past: diabetes, hypertension, cancers, bone disease, heart disease. Communities need to go back to the diverse diets they had many generations ago.” There has been a coup d’état on our plates, explains Naidoo. “Many families in South Africa face the double burden of malnourishment and obesity.

Four years ago, the village’s water supply was cut off by the new owner of a neighbouring farm, Thaba Thabo (ironically meaning “mountain of happiness”). He claimed that the water that they had always had access to from a nearby mountain belonged to him, and that villagers would need to pay R2,500 a month for it.

But the situation has still not been resolved. Although the Setsoto Municipality has told villagers that this was illegal, it has not acted against the farmer. Instead, it sent engineers to the village twice to sink boreholes – and twice the engineers refused to listen to villagers about where the water was and sunk boreholes that have not yielded water. Now, it sends water trucks intermittently. Young men in the village were so angry that they planned to ambush the farmer but the trust’s leaders dissuaded them from doing so.

Naidoo’s frustration is palpable: “What we have in this country today is a sense of impunity that has spread to the rest of the political elites or the economic elites to a point where a farmer thinks it is his right to cut off water to the village of Naledi. We have a municipal official who feels he doesn’t care a damn, he won’t lose a minute’s sleep, that three years later, 170 people, a third of them being children, have no access to drinking water.
