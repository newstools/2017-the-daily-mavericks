In an unprecedented move in Zimbabwe’s recent history, the Zimbabwean military took control of the state broadcaster and Harare International Airport is under military watch, and on Wednesday morning placed President Robert Mugabe and First Lady Grace under house arrest. Throughout this, General Constantino Chiwenga, Commander of the Zimbabwean Defence Force, has maintained that this is not a coup.

Mr Mugabe must resign in line with national expectation and sentiment in order for a transitional mechanism to take affect.” We are aware of the international community’s concerns over the deteriorating situation in the country,” said Tsvangirai of the military’s not-a-coup coup, “and therefore there is an urgent need for a road map to political legitimacy.

However,Tsvangirai maintains that this mechanism must be agreed upon by all stakeholders, and should be done through a free and fair election process. “This is the only way that we can define the future of this democratic dispensation,” he said.

People walked through the streets on their way to and from work, seemingly unaffected by the events of recent days. The only signs of the political turmoil that’s playing out in the upper echelons of power are the standard infantry in APCs stationed outside key buildings such as Parliament, the High Court and the airport, while the Presidential Guard was stationed outside the Zanu-PF headquarters. There has also been a noticeable absence of police officers in the streets – which one resident happily pointed out due to their notoriety for corruption and bribe-taking. Military helicopters occasionally flew overhead. Meanwhile, on the streets of Harare, it appeared to be business as usual.

This reporter has passed through two so far: one coming out of the airport with nothing more than a cursory inspection of the driver and passenger, and another where the occupants of the car were politely asked to step out so it could be searched for weapons.
