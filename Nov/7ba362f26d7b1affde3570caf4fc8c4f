  1  1   1 On Monday, a vehicle stopped on Johannesburg’s M1 highway after a wheel on the trailer it was towing was dislodged. Traffic was blocked and metro police arrived to find the open trailer was carrying 42 coffins, covered by only a tarpaulin. There were 16 adult bodies and those of 26 stillborn babies. The bodies were being moved from Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital to Olifantsvlei Cemetery for paupers’ burials.

This appears to be the latest in a series of signs showing how the department is effectively dysfunctional.

One of the reasons put forward by the provincial health department for proceeding with the plan that led to the deaths of 143 psychiatric patients was its dire need to cut costs. The department planned to pay to NGOs around a third of what Life Esidimeni received and around a tenth of what state institutions cost to take care of patients.

On Wednesday, Democratic Nurses Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) Gauteng provincial chairperson Simphiwe Gada called for national Treasury to intervene. “Over the past months we have witnessed the Gauteng department of health becoming the playground of the Sheriff of the Court, and bank accounts of the department being attached by the court, unpaid pay progression and incentive bonuses of workers to the tune of R829-million and a shortfall in the compensation of employees budget to the tune of R916-million,” he said. “All these are signs that the department of health is under siege and cannot cope with these challenges.” On Wednesday, Democratic Nurses Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) Gauteng provincial chairperson Simphiwe Gada called for national Treasury to intervene. “Over the past months we have witnessed the Gauteng department of health becoming the playground of the Sheriff of the Court, and bank accounts of the department being attached by the court, unpaid pay progression and incentive bonuses of workers to the tune of R829-million and a shortfall in the compensation of employees budget to the tune of R916-million,” he said. “All these are signs that the department of health is under siege and cannot cope with these challenges.”   4  4   4 Gada said national government must intervene to ensure Gauteng can deliver health services and retain workers.

It’s clear, however, that it’s not only lacking funds but also lacking the responsible leadership needed to care for the province’s citizens. Coffins are stranded on the highway and the department is trying to explain how 143 psychiatric patients died. Gauteng health not only needs a budgetary boost, but an overhaul.
