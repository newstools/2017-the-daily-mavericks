       A phone call from President Jacob Zuma on the eve of the Eskom board meeting scheduled for 26 February 2015 led to the postponement of what was meant to be the first gathering since the appointment of new members late in 2014. The president had called Eskom board chairperson Zola Tsotsi after he had been unable to get hold of the public enterprises minister or the deputy to say he could expect a call from the public enterprises acting director-general.

That presidential phone call was followed up less than a week later by a call from then SAA board chairperson Dudu Myeni, who is also chairperson of the JG Zuma Foundation, calling Tsotsi to a meeting at the presidential residence in Durban.

Ms Myeni then proceeded to outline the purpose of the meeting, namely, that the situation of Eskom’s financial stress and poor technical performance warrants that an inquiry into the company be instituted. She further elaborated that, in the course of the said enquiry, three executives, namely acting Chief Executive Tshediso Matona, Group Executive for Group Capital Dan Marokane and Group Executive for Commercial Matshela Koko, are to be suspended… On or about 7 March 2015, I arrived at the Durban presidential residence and was met by Dudu Myeni, her son Talent, and a certain Mr Nick Lennell, who was introduced to me as a lawyer.

But he battled to explain during the subsequent questions why he didn’t ask why this invitation to a meeting on Eskom had come from someone who has nothing to do with Eskom and was held at the presidential residence.

Did he regard himself as having been given his marching orders from the highest level?

After an initial meeting, the minister was invited to a second one a couple of days later on 11 March when the suspensions were agreed to. Tsotsi explained there was no one on the board who opposed; it was only a question of whether there could not have been another human resources process, for example, recusal.

At the time, in 2015, Brown publicly appealed for space for this “deep-dive” investigation into the state of affairs at Eskom. That eventually led to the Denton report, the full release of which has been pushed for by the DA after a heavily redacted document was made available amid official insistence, including from Brown, that most of its recommendations had been implemented.

By 23 May 2015 also gone was Tsotsi, who earlier told MPs how Tony Gupta told him days before the 2015 State of the nation Address (SONA) that he was “not helping us with anything. We are the ones who put you in the position you are in. We are the ones who can take you out.” Officially Tsotsi resigned, but on Wednesday he described his departure as a “removal” after the board had obtained a legal opinion that was critical of his on the job performance and proffered “trumped up” charges.

The official narrative is that Molefe beat load shedding that cost South Africa’s economy over R400-million a day – and for this he received a glowing endorsement not only from the board, but also the minister. But at the same time unfolded the controversial R1.6-billion pre-paid coal deal that ultimately enabled the Gupta-linked Tegeta to purchase Optimum coal mine from Glencore, and payments to the Gupta-linked Trillian Capital Partners in its off-the-books dealings with McKinsey.

Koko was the only executive who returned to Eskom and was appointed acting chief executive before he was suspended for dodgy contracts, including one to a company run by his stepdaughter. According to earlier testimony to the inquiry by Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma, initial steps by the board to suspend Koko earlier this year were averted when Zethembe Khoza – he was acting Eskom board chairperson after Ngubane resigned amid the controversy over Molefe’s early retirement/resignation earlier this year – alerted a “G-brother”. The unnamed Gupta brother in turn called Brown, who called the board chairperson. That’s why Brown was captured, according to Qoma.
