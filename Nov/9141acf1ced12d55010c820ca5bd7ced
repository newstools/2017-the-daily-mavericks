       An interdepartmental task team of the Departments of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, Agriculture, Health and Social development briefed MPs on progress with the National Food and Nutrition Security Plan (2017-2022). The amount needed for implementation of this plan was staggering. The actual plan was less spectacular with role-players in civil society already questioning how workable it will be. The plan must still be submitted to Cabinet so MPs had the first peak at the proposed costing model for this project. Its aim is to alleviate hunger among 14-million South Africans. The figure is based on StatSA’s statistics on hunger.

The biggest cost driver will be projects to increase food production and access to nutritious and affordable food. More than R67-billion is proposed to fund this exercise which will include capacitating and integrating smallholder farmers in local food value chains.

The plan is to double the number of extension officers that will help capacitate smallholder farmers and households, especially through training. Ngoma said the idea was to increase food production in households. “Producers can then produce their own food rather than relying on supermarkets for food.” Part of this component of the plan was to increase the number of extension officers generally regarded as government’s foot soldiers and the first contact with households, she said.

The councils will have an oversight and co-ordination function. Ngoma said that to reduce costs, the government is hoping to use sector experts who will work with the councils, but they “should be willing to do so for an honorarium payment, rather than full consultant rates”. The plan also includes efforts to promote good nutrition, especially among women, infants, and children. The estimated costs for this is R7-billion. To communicate the plan and promote its aims, a communication strategy to the cost of R703-million is also considered.

DA MP Annette Steyn, however, reminded the task team that food security is also about access to food. “A third of all food in South Africa is wasted. We have enough food, it’s just not with the people.” During question time MPs welcomed the plan in principle as it opens up opportunities to have a much-needed discussion on food security in South Africa.

They are still looking for money to fund education for the poor and departments are already complaining about money,” Maloyi asked, urging the task team to look at alternative funding models.

She said small-scale farmers in her area were already struggling to get support from government. “We are struggling. We struggle with land, we struggle with access to water. People want to grow their own food and many do but they struggle to market their produce. I mean, nobody really wants to pay for vegetables at a Pick n Pay if you can grow your own food. It is healthier, but these departments promise and promise and promise.

One of its members, Dave Golding, told ParlyBeat that the need is there now, not over five years. He said in his experience the departments often assist with resources but there was little training and mentoring or any follow-up processes.
