Jordaan could have spared us the rest of the bullshit and led with that last part, which finally rings true: Jordaan wants his rights protected. By implication, he feels that his rights have been violated up to now. That’s pretty rich coming from a man now accused of rape by three women, but let’s humour him for a second. If Jordaan feels that his rights have been violated by the media dragging his good name through the mud, that is at least partly self-inflicted.
