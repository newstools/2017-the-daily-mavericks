Prior to the 1905-1917 struggles for human emancipation in Russia, like many societies all over the world, sexual practices were highly oppressive and violent. Sexual behaviours were dictated by the capitalist and patriarchal norms of the church and the Tsarist dictatorship. Women were the “second sex” and homosexuality was considered deviant.

Approaches to achieving Kollontai’s ambitions were done in various radical ways that completely undermined the bourgeois reformist approaches to the “women question”. After 1917, the Bolshevik-led Soviet power attempted to produce equal opportunities for women’s participation in economic and political structures, through education and training programmes, legislature and public domestic infrastructures. Some of the earliest legislation dealt directly with structures that would free women of domestic labours and the patriarchal aspects of traditional marriage and family life. Women were assured “equal pay for equal work” and found new opportunities to enter historically male-dominated industries. There was an insistence on creating public institutions that socialised what was previously the domestic/private work among women, in the forms of public childcare facilities, dining halls, laundry houses, schools, maternity care etc. As Russian Revolutionary Leon Trotsky wrote in his 1936 book,  Approaches to achieving Kollontai’s ambitions were done in various radical ways that completely undermined the bourgeois reformist approaches to the “women question”.

Yet, Lenin was clear that laws alone would not change the position of women, noting that radical legal changes were “of course, only the beginning”. Unlike contemporary efforts such as South Africa’s Women’s Department, or the United Nations Women, it was understood that because the oppression of women is based on a constructed idea of them as inferior, having a governmental organ for women was but a transitional moment.

The likes of Krupskaya and Kollontai, who had led the charge for radical institutional approaches to sexual and gender liberation, continued to criticise the various ways in which Stalin’s rule was destroying not only the gains they had won for women, but the socialist policies and practices developed since the revolutionary period.
