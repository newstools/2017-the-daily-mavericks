Equal Education (EE) hopes to force the departments of basic education and transport in KwaZulu-Natal to provide transport for pupils with disabilities in the impoverished Nqutu area.        EE is concerned about a lack of a transport plan for pupils travelling to 12 schools in the area. Investigating conditions in the area, it learnt that a mother had to carry her daughter to school until she was no longer able to do so. Another learner had to drive her electric wheelchair 5km because she cannot afford private transport. EE is concerned about a lack of a transport plan for pupils travelling to 12 schools in the area.
