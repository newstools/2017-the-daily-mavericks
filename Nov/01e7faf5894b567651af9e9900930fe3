The Life Esidimeni arbitration continues to investigate how 143 psychiatric patients died after the department moved them to NGOs and into home care. Last week it heard testimony from suspended provincial mental health director Dr Makgabo Manamela, who was evasive and refused to take personal responsibility. The Esidimeni arbitration has highlighted chronic problems in the Gauteng health system and forced officials to act.

In his report on Life Esidimeni, Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba recommended Makhura and Motsoaledi take a stronger role in turning the department around. The intervention team they announced on Sunday will be headed by Professor Mkhululi Lukhele from Wits. He will be supported by Professor Craig Househam, Dr Edith Mntla, and Nomvula Marawa.

Ramokgopa, who was returned to the MEC post after Qedani Mahlangu resigned in the wake of the Esidimeni tragedy, said, “If we go at this pace, we take long to get where we are supposed to go. So the intervention team is to come in and help us move as fast and as expediently as possible.” This team is going to be able to help us to say why did we have the collapse in this area,” said Makhura.

For years, provincial officials have been exposed as underperforming and unaccountable. The Esidimeni arbitration has brought its failures to light, as did the recent incident where 42 bodies in coffins were stranded on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. The department received an increase in its budget allocation recently as suppliers had not been paid and assets had been seized by the Sheriff of the Court.

Motsoaledi said he had few powers to intervene in provincial health matters. Makhura claimed that past interventions led to improvements, but the department suffered serious problems late last year. “I am certain that there has been recovery that has been drastically undermined,” said the premier, adding that 2016 marked “a very drastic deterioration of the department of health and that’s after it has recovered substantially.

Ramokgopa said the team is crucial, considering the head of department is on suspension and its chief financial officer and head of legal have resigned recently. She said the intervention must find a way to hold senior officials accountable. Makhura said it must investigate corruption and hold officials accountable.

The DA’s Jack Bloom said multiple turn-around plans had failed in the past. “Top-level political support will be needed for the new team to succeed as many incompetent deployed cadres should be fired and politically-connected corruption networks destroyed. Massive surgery will be needed to remove all the rot.

But the minister and the premier were aware as early as September 2016 that at least 36 patients had died after being moved from Life Esidimeni. Their teams worked diligently to implement the ombudsman’s most crucial recommendations, those that would save further psychiatric patients from dying.

Only now have they realised that the Gauteng health department is dysfunctional and requires urgent intervention. The task team, if it’s effective, should be welcomed, but as the officials dithered, many patients might have died or received inadequate care.
