But, said De Wet, that practice note has been replaced by the 2017 Government Notice.

These subclasses represent bread that is baked using brown wheat flour and classifies ‘brown wheat bread’ differently from ‘brown bread’. Brown bread now no longer includes brown wheat bread. As a result, the zero rating provision is now limited and will not apply to brown wheat bread. In order to maintain the status quo, the proposed amendment should have also replaced the term ‘brown bread’ with ‘brown wheat bread’,” he said in a statement.
