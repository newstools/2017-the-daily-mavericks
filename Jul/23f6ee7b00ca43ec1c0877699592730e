We finally got our wish. Guillaume van Keirsbulck thought to hell with it all and sprinted out in front of the peloton to take a lonely, lonely lead basically right from the start. At one stage, he was a whole 13 minutes ahead. We finally got our wish. Guillaume van Keirsbulck thought to hell with it all and sprinted out in front of the peloton to take a lonely, lonely lead basically right from the start. At one stage, he was a whole 13 minutes ahead. Not deterred by his poor life decisions, Van Keirsbulck continued on his merry, lonely way, desperately trying to keep his massive lead, but the peloton wasn t having any of it. The gap continued to close. Not deterred by his poor life decisions, Van Keirsbulck continued on his merry, lonely way, desperately trying to keep his massive lead, but the peloton wasn t having any of it. The gap continued to close. But, we did learn something. Benoni is not just a little place on the East Rand. Turns out, there are people called Benoni. Oh, if only they knew. According to the official Le Tour website: Guillaume van Keirsbulck is the grandson of Benoni Beheyt, the 1963 world champion who rode for himself instead of leading out his leader Rik van Looy and won stage 22 in the 1964 Tour de France in Versailles but had a short career as he quit at the age of 26.

Every day is a school day, huh? Every day is a school day, huh? What happened on Stage 4? What happened on Stage 4? Well, even if you aren t into cycling, the sprint finish of Stage 4 was fantastically thrilling. It had everything. Furious gesticulating, epic sprints, Dimension Data pushing it right to the end, a crash and even a sneaky elbow.

For all of Van Keirsbulck s efforts to ride the 200-plus kilometres like it was the longest time trial of his life, the peloton eventually caught up at the 16km mark. Yes, this is a marathon after all. What followed, though, would mean that the poor lonely bugger s efforts are completely forgotten. Let s start with our lone ranger.

The final few kilometres were pretty flat and the peloton went balls to the wall (or is that leather?) for the final stretch. It was tight as sardines in a vacuum pack, which might be what it feels like to squeeze into Team Sky s vortex suit.

Dimension Data, riding for Qhubeka, muscled their way to the front of the group, slipping out from the slipstream at around 6km to go all in support of Mark I won t win a stage Cavendish. With things tight and messy, Astana s lieutenant started to gesticulate like Bompi about being squeezed out of position.

Some armchair critics claimed that it was actually a knock-on effect of somebody else shoving Sagan, but Sagan is who we clearly see lifting an elbow, so Sagan is the villain for today.

And hey, we gotta give credit to Cavendish here. What on earth he was doing thinking he could worm himself through that gap, nobody knows. But that s Cav, fearless as a Jack Russell.

Sagan headed over to the team bus to try and say sorry.

It s a little bit hilly, but just one category three climb. However, the climb will be demanding, not just because it comes late in the stage, but also because they ve been at it for a few days now.
