       The Cosatu marches (on Wednesday 28 September) brought to mind the “self-hostage” scene in Mel Brooks’ movie Blazing Saddles, arguably the best parody of the Western – and commentary on political correctness – ever made.

The marches were against a destructive phenomenon to which it is a party. Cosatu didn’t participate in the anti-Zuma protests in March because it did not agree with the demand for Jacob Zuma’s removal. Although State Capture is about so much more than Zuma, “mass” marches against State Capture just two months before the ANC’s elective conference aren’t convincing.

To add insult to ignominy, when Councillor Michael Sun went out to collect a memorandum from the marchers on behalf of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba, a Cosatu leader resorted to racial stereotyping in describing Mr Sun.

There are a many reasons for this, but the most significant was Cosatu’s expelling its largest affiliate, the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa). A number of smaller unions followed Numsa.
