It has been five months since the South African Council of Churches released its Unburdening Panel report to the churches.

In this rolling saga some heads have rolled, sacrificially, but the project remains capable of marching on relentlessly, with almost unstoppable bravado. The SACC Triennial Conference in June concluded that the rot is so deep and so widespread in the governmental environment that it would be difficult to reverse, and that in time the hard-slogging honest-to-goodness civil servants would be totally side-lined in areas of significant fiscal decision-making and control.

Even when the Constitutional Court fingers Parliament for this malpractice, Parliament goes on as if nothing has happened. One would have expected a democratic legislature that respects the Constitution to have appreciated the corrective message from the ConCourt’s judgment, and at least, out of a healthy conscience, pass a motion of regret in deference to the judgment – Dololo. Might it be that a healthy conscience is politically incorrect in Parliament these days?

With the Prophet Micah we say: “Is it not for you to know justice?

Why is it that ordinary members of the party do not see this? Why is the NEC not living up to its duty to preserve the future of the ANC? Where is everybody in there?

Can Umkhonto weSizwe, that anchor of the ANC justice campaigns over whose war we as churches wrestled with each other over the application or otherwise of the just war principle, can they not come together and find a way to stop the bus? Can the collective of the experience of ANC Veterans and Stalwarts not bring sanity to prevail, to salvage the life project of all those who sacrificed over the last 105 years of blood, sweat and tears?

There is another story to fall back on – that before 1994, not many professional politicians were the hope of a South Africa for all. It was trade unions and civil society organisations, and religious organisations, especially the SACC, the Muslim Judicial Council and Jews for Justice, that stood up as organised structures of apartheid resistance. That is the other story of our hope. But then the ANC history of positive struggles for a just and caring society is not all of South Africa’s history.

But instead to turn to organs of civil society and our congregations to generate hope for the post-apartheid promise of South Africa – a just, equitable, reconciled, peaceful and sustainable South Africa, free of racist, tribalist, xenophobic and gender prejudices and violence; free of corruption and deprivation, where every child born is free to develop to its God-given potential.

As a nation today, we are where the apartheid regime was in the late 1980s, a junk economy, a securocratic State, assassinations by the day, social unrest and loss of public trust in the government. It is a government that says in true Botha-Vorster language that priests must confine themselves to the altars and pulpits of their churches and not engage on matters of life that are governed by politicians.

We believe the nation will find it in the National Convention of South Africa, where organs of civil society, labour federations, business organisations and the various faith traditions will hammer out the values and standards of South African living that we shall demand of politicians who seek our trust to manage our affairs of State.
