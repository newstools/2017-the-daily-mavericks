       Nearly three centuries ago, English author Jonathan Swift wrote his infamous “Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick”. In his bitter satiric essay, Swift had proposed a solution to alleviate the chronic food shortages, seeming over-population, and growing poverty in Ireland under English rule.

In his bitter satiric essay, Swift had proposed a solution to alleviate the chronic food shortages, seeming over-population, and growing poverty in Ireland under English rule.         To cope with this array of challenges, Swift argued, Irish families could solve all these challenges simultaneously simply by allowing them to fatten up and then sell off their excess children as a nutritious food source for the dining pleasure of rich Englishmen. Bitter satire? Yes, of course, but his point was that British rule and the failure to recognise those dreadful policies had led to the crisis in Ireland.

And so it is on to Las Vegas last Sunday. The latest mass shooting outrage in America – this time in Las Vegas at the site of an outdoor Country & Western concert – was carried out by a man with an arsenal sufficient for a small country facing an invasion. He was ensconced in a 32nd floor hotel suite, supplied courtesy of the casino because of his high roller gambler history. When it came time to start his killing spree, Stephen Paddock, the shooter, had a clear line of fire at the vast crowd beneath him and killed nearly 60 men, women and children, and wounded hundreds more.

As a result of Paddock’s actions, the fighting over proposals to somehow rein in the carnage wrought by killers with firearms will heat up all over again. There will be those who insist on some tougher restrictions on firearms ownership and the type of weapons that are legal, in the wake of this latest atrocity with all those casualties and fatalities. But there will also be, arrayed in steadfast opposition, numerous politicians, those odious National Rifle Association lobbyists, and a host of those professionally paranoid survivalists and similarly confused citizens. Of those opposed to any further gun control, they will wrap themselves in the wording (and presumed meaning) of the US Constitution’s Second Amendment as their ultimate protection against the leviathan state’s presumed depredations upon the liberties of ordinary citizens.

In fact, former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court John Paul Stevens made a similar proposal, recommending a slightly reworded second amendment to read: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms when serving in the Militia shall not be infringed.” If one reads this sentence just after all those rights to free speech, religion, assembly and so forth that are enumerated in the US constitution’s first amendment, this business about firearms would have been rather easily recognisable as a narrowly defined right of citizens to participate in the nation’s defence when necessary, but a right that also came equipped with the balancing obligation of their participation in that well-regulated militia stipulated right there in the amendment.

Once passed by the several states, this 10-part Bill of Rights became part of the basic governing document on 15 December 1791.

The philosophical origins of the second amendment actually reach back through English history to the 17th and 18th centuries, protecting the rights of ordinary yeomen to defend themselves against the likely depredations of a royal army at the hands of an autocrat or rampaging general. However, one of the more immediate reasons for it being proposed to the states and then quickly adopted was the after-effect of Shay’s Rebellion. Taking place largely in western Massachusetts, Shay’s Rebellion was an armed protest by hard-pressed farmers against a period of growing economic hardship that threatened the state government’s hold on authority. The rebellion was eventually suppressed, but only after the Massachusetts militia had been summoned to put down the rising.

That the new nation might well be beset by yet other challenges helped make the case for state militias (later to become the Army National Guard), with an explicit right to join to be held by citizens and that this right could not be withdrawn should some form of new tyranny arise, down the road.

Over the years, this constitutional provision has been the subject of a number of Supreme Court decisions in respect of (mostly) local and state laws. These have usually been about the extent to which this amendment supersedes any legislative restrictions over the type of weaponry citizens might own – or who might legally own them. Despite claims by some that this amendment offers an absolute right, no challenges have ever been brought successfully against laws that prevent ordinary citizens from legally owning things like working tanks and howitzers, and fully functioning jet fighter planes, or, more improbably, aircraft carriers or nuclear-tipped missiles.

As a result, people can rather easily make their purchases in states with less rigorous controls, and then bring their lethal hardware back to a different state with harsher restrictions on guns.

There is still the potent tug of the myth of the frontier in all its incarnations that helps animate this for many. The logic of it is along the lines of: a man’s home is his castle. It is his task is to be prepared to defend it and his family against all those potential marauding savages, those bandits and outlaws and even the occasional out-of-control, rogue army riding down from the distant hills in order to destroy the civilisation that has been so painfully achieved. And hunting was obviously an essential part of putting a venison roast on the dinner table as well, or fending off the wolves or mountain lions eager to kill one’s cattle or sheep. This myth is still strong, as myths tend to be, even if most Americans no longer live near the settlement frontier or have to cope with Butch Cassidy and Sundance, grizzly bears or mountain lions in the course of their daily life.

Moreover, the duly constituted government will never arrive in time and so a citizen must do whatever is necessary, as in Gary Cooper-style in High Noon, or Alan Ladd in Shane. In spite of the consistent decline in most crime categories in the US for the past several decades, some gun owners continue to insist their firearms are still virtually the only things that prevent death and destruction by rampaging criminals in the country’s cities, as in their overheated slogan that argues: once there is real gun control, only criminals will still have guns.

Now, that ideological bent has also become intertwined with the ideas of those who figure – in a kind of inversion of that “well regulated” bit in the second amendment – that almost any gun control regimen, no matter how rational or sensible, would somehow lay honest folks open to the worst possible depredations from their government, now bending inevitably towards dictatorship or worse. Such a sensibility has grown increasingly powerful on the part of some in the aftermath of a deliberate decay of governmental truth-telling during the Vietnam conflict, the various government scandals that have subsequently proved the government is always up to no good, and a low-level but persistent, sustained resistance to government on the part of some in the western states because of the federal government’s management of large swathes of western land, the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion.

Then, of course, there has been a toxic mix of the National Rifle Association (NRA), its donors, members and friends, and a wide swathe of the country’s elected officials. The NRA started out as an association largely dedicated to firearms safety and the servicing of gun clubs. That was probably rather boring and in the years after the Second World War, it embraced a new purpose – a broad-based political defence of the second amendment and thus equally fervent support (including generous campaign contributions) of like-minded politicians and tough campaigns against anyone disagreeing with them. In this way, the NRA became one of the great lobbying powerhouses of Washington.

NRA members even reloaded ammunition for those guarding war plants. Incidentally, the NRA’s call to help arm Britain in 1940 resulted in the collection of more than 7,000 firearms for Britain’s defense against potential invasion by Germany (Britain had virtually disarmed itself with a series of gun-control laws enacted between World War I and World War II)….

In response to repeated attacks on the Second Amendment rights, NRA formed the Legislative Affairs Division in 1934. While NRA did not lobby directly at this time, it did mail out legislative facts and analyses to members, whereby they could take action on their own.

Hunter Education courses are now taught by state fish and game departments across the country and Canada and have helped make hunting one of the safest sports in existence. Due to increasing interest in hunting, NRA launched a new magazine in 1973, The American Hunter, dedicated solely to hunting issues year-round.

And that, of course, also takes the shape of strident advertising against politicians supportive of some form of control.

In that spirit, let us propose a carefully articulated campaign consisting of several interrelated parts, and insure every group opposed to gun violence joins in pushing these proposals forward. Let this campaign work just as hard as the NRA has done for the past several generations in building a support base for guns. Of course this will be an uphill battle, even if a majority of Americans continue to support stronger gun control measures.

Maybe the Supreme Court will actually fix this in the current court calendar and the will of citizens will be more accurately reflected. But that should not mean the greater gun control campaign must wait.
