  1  1   1 President Jacob Zuma was in Limpopo on Tuesday to open three Botlokwa bridges across the N1 highway. It was a security-heavy occasion, replete with red ribbon, so the President could take on the role of deliverer of people’s needs. “The bridges that we are officially opening are a visible example of government’s commitment to deliver strategic infrastructure that will transform our economy, create jobs and stimulate opportunities for growth… This project demonstrates the fact that government responds to the needs expressed by communities and the priorities they identify,” said Zuma’s prepared speech.

The South African Communist Party (SACP) described the dropping of its leader Blade Nzimande from Cabinet as a “factional removal” and “a clear declaration of war”.

Therefore, it has a place in government, and access to its strategic levers of power, as part of the governing collective. Cabinet does not belong to any individual, nor did government, was Tuesday’s refrain, amid teeth gritted in anger, at the SACP media briefing.

Last year it was the ANC’s top echelon’s acceptance of Zuma’s (non)-apology on 1 April for the “frustration and confusion” caused by the Nkandla saga – and deciding its best course of action was to explain to ANC structures countrywide that with the court-ordered repayment after over three years’ of public outcry for the non-security benefits of cattle kraal, swimming (fire) pool, amphitheatre and chicken run, the drama was now a closed chapter.

Now Nzimande has been thrown under the bus, perhaps as a warning to others in the now loudly critical SACP of what might befall them.

And so Zuma explained to the ANC integrity committee that he could not step down as this would realise the push by Western imperialist forces. Or as City Press quoted from the ANC integrity committee’s report dated May 2017 after meeting Zuma: “The essence of the president’s refusal to resign is his belief that there exists a conspiracy by Western governments to oust him as president of the ANC and of the country.

Earlier in 2017 the Western Cape High Court set aside a series of inter-governmental agreements, including one with Russia, that were meant to be the basis for securing the nuclear deal. Then energy minister Mmamoloko Kubayi decided not to appeal, in stark contrast to many of her Cabinet colleagues who appeal adverse findings in search of a favourable outcome. Kubayi on Tuesday became the second energy minister to have fallen because of non-delivery of that deal, after her predecessor Tina Joemat-Pettersson. But she stayed in Cabinet and is now in charge of communications, previously headed by Ayanda Dlodlo, an outsider in the dominant factions who failed to deliver a pliant public broadcaster.
