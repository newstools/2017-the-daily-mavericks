       The SABC is slowly recovering from years of abuse. In 2016-17, the public broadcaster suffered losses of R977-million. Production companies’ fees, musicians’ royalties and the businesses that rely on them weren’t paid, or their invoices were paid in trickling portions. The SABC’s most influential leader, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, in 2016 enforced an untested local content policy, banned violent protest footage – to the benefit of the ANC before an election – and persecuted eight journalists who opposed his rule.

Zuma is complicit in supporting the corrosion, in fact benefiting from it, as he backed a system that, despite a Public Protector’s report, public criticism, and repeated losses in court, gave the country’s favourite masochist puppet, Motsoeneng, the keys to the safe and the remote control to the country’s culture.

The portfolio committee on communications then appointed an interim SABC board, after – one person after another – the past board resigned. The committee has recommended a permanent board to Zuma. The SABC already appears to be turning around under the interim board, after Motsoeneng and his cronies were forced out. Weeks later, however, the president hasn’t appointed the recommended board.

On Tuesday she said Zuma had been burnt in the past by SABC board appointments. Some members he approved were either unqualified or had criminal records and he was waiting on background checks before appointing the new recommended board. But the interim board’s mandate has expired while Zuma continues to “apply his mind”. Recently appointed Minister Dlodlo is at least taking governance more seriously than her predecessor.

The president supports those who support those who support him. That’s the way it works. Former communications minister Faith Muthambi was derelict, but she backed Motsoeneng, who enforced pro-Zuma policies at the SABC. She was only removed when the writing was on the wall, after members of the ANC stood against her. Motsoeneng had exhausted his court appeals and was unlikely to return to the top floors of the SABC.  Why wouldn’t he? Zuma abuses the SABC.
