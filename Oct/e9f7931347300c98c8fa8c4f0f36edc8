       Napoleon reportedly set out the popular dictum: “Geography is destiny”, in reference to his vision of a French-led pan-European empire. This idea has subsequently been used by later conquerors and economists to explain – and sometimes to justify – everything from the urge for national expansion such as America’s “manifest destiny” and Germany’s reach for “lebensraum”, to explanations for poor economic development where a lack of a sea coast and difficult transport have limited growth such as economist Jeffrey Sachs’ writing about weak sister economies. And it has also been used to describe the luck some nations have encountered when they discovered their country sat atop vast amounts of sticky black goo that can be pumped to the surface and sold for vast fortunes.

But in our age, the Corsican “Little Corporal’s” idea must to be restated somewhat. Nowadays, perhaps it is demography that is destiny – especially where democratic nations are concerned. We shall explore this from several different perspectives not usually much discussed abroad where people increasingly focus on the Twitter drivel that sometimes passes for political discourse – but that are now vitally important for American political life.

In short, Wisconsin’s redistricting was a textbook version of gerrymandering.         Gerrymandering, of course, has had a long American history. In fact, the very term comes from the name of one early 19th century Massachusetts governor, Elbridge Gerry. His influence over his state’s redistricting on behalf of his party had produced districts so bizarrely shaped that some of them, per local lore and, most especially, a savage political cartoon of the time, closely resembled the shape of salamanders, hence the neologism: gerrymandering.

In 2010, Republicans won unified control of Wisconsin’s government for the first time in years. They were determined not to lose it any time soon, so they turned the decennial redistricting process, which began in 2011, into a clandestine partisan operation. They set up a ‘map room’ at a Republican-allied law firm, used refined data analyses to draw new, Republican-friendly district lines, and invited only Republican lawmakers to come in and see their new districts — after they signed non-disclosure agreements.

It worked. In 2012, the first election using the new maps, Republican candidates won 48 percent of the vote, but 60 of the state’s 99 legislative seats. The Democrats’ 51 percent that year translated into only 39 seats, yet two years later, when the Republicans won the same share of the vote, they ended up with 63 seats — a 24-seat differential. In other words, Republicans had figured out how to draw maps to lock in their legislative majority no matter how many, or few, votes they received. [Italics added]  It worked.

But, also important, this decision will probably also have a major impact on other states that have equally bizarre, modern versions of Gov Gerry’s salamanders. And that could well lead to a much tighter balance of Democrats and Republicans elected to Congress, perhaps even as early as 2018’s midterm election. And that, in turn, could have a significant impact on the ability of Republicans to succeed with a whole raft of proposals that would require congressional votes. Demography, especially when connected to congressional bean counting, does indeed go hand-in-hand with destiny.

Yes, of course, its major initial impact was devastation across many of the islands in the Caribbean Sea, including the British and American Virgin Islands, the French and Dutch half-half-owned island of St Martin/St Maarten. And then there is Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is different from all the others deeply affected by Hurricane Maria, largely because of the size of its population, over three million people, as well as the fact that all of its inhabitants are already American citizens from birth and thus have the right to move to the continental US any time they wish.

Puerto Rico is not a state, but, rather, a commonwealth of the US, as is Guam, for example. The bargain for Puerto Rico, early in the 20th century, was that while its inhabitants would be citizens, they could not vote in national elections as it was not a state, but – crucially – they would not be subject to any federal taxes. So far at least, a majority of the island’s inhabitants have supported this deal in several referenda on the choice of continued commonwealth status, statehood or independence.

But, over the years, large communities of people of Puerto Rican origin have continued to migrate to the mainland, especially to the states of Florida (such as in and around the city of Orlando), New York, New Jersey, and several of the New England states. And, of course, the moment they arrived on the mainland, they were citizens of those states and they had the right to register to vote.

While, in socio-economic terms, Puerto Rican-Americans would seem to be likely Democrats – even though the political ecology on the island differs somewhat from that of the mainland – the migrants tend to vote in line with those socio-economic factors once they are in the US itself. However, if, as would seem increasingly likely, a large new influx of Puerto Ricans moves to the continental US for economic reasons – if there are no jobs because of the economic destruction on the island after the hurricane they must go somewhere to survive and many Puerto Ricans already have family ties on the mainland – they are likely to carry with them some rather potent anger about the lackadaisical response to their distress from the Trump administration, anger over Trump’s public snit fight with the mayor of San Juan, and some annoyance with the reluctance of the US Congress to deal with the island’s virtual bankruptcy that had come about even before the hurricane’s damage.

Now, put this possibly extensive population movement together with the fact that Florida, now one of the country’s largest states in population terms, also has a major slice of the presidential electoral vote. Moreover, in recent years Florida has been trending away from the increasing Republican domination that has been characteristic of it since the late 1960s when the Nixonian Southern strategy was put in motion to peel the South from its traditional Democratic support. Accordingly, an influx of Puerto Rican migrants might just push Florida into the semi-permanent blue state column for elections.

So it could be quite politically significant that tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans, maybe more, are expected to permanently move into Florida as the result of Hurricane Maria. The Category 4 storm has wreaked havoc on the US territory of 3.4-million. Most of the island still doesn’t have power a week after Maria made landfall. There are shortages of fuel, medicine, food and running water. Infrastructure that was already crumbling is in ruins.

Florida-based Republican operative Rick Wilson thinks the hurricane might be a game changer. ‘If you put an influx of 100,000 Puerto Ricans who vote Democratic eight times out of 10 in the Orlando area, there you go,’ he said. ‘Nobody can afford a big change in the registration pattern or a change in the voting pattern that offsets Florida’s narrowness. You could end up with a big advantage for Democrats in 2018 if they play it right. The Puerto Ricans would be coming here because they feel like Donald Trump left them high and dry.

But, if Florida were moved definitively out of the Republican column for 2020, that would make it a much bigger hill to climb for the GOP for them to continue to hold the presidency. This is because the Florida electoral vote count is over 10% of the total number of electoral votes needed to win the White House. Here again, demography can become destiny for presidential contenders.

If you’re poor and you go through a tough period, you use all your savings to get through it,’ ” Eisenach said. “ ‘If you go from having very little to doubling that, you still may not have very much, but you see a big percentage gain.’ ” If you’re poor and you go through a tough period, you use all your savings to get through it,’ ” Eisenach said. “ ‘If you go from having very little to doubling that, you still may not have very much, but you see a big percentage gain.’ ” If you’re poor and you go through a tough period, you use all your savings to get through it,’ ” Eisenach said. “ ‘If you go from having very little to doubling that, you still may not have very much, but you see a big percentage gain.’ ”        This kind of improvement on the part of minorities, despite the greater gains of the wealthy, and the continuing overall black/white family wealth gap, may well have encouraged significant numbers of people who ultimately voted for Donald Trump to feel they had been left behind and that minorities were gaining “unfair” advantage in a tough economic period in the years after the recovery from the 2008-9 financial crisis. Someone like Trump with his rough populist rhetoric and dog whistles was in their corner. If that is true, then the political advantage for the future, once again, will fall to the party and candidate that can most convincingly offer reassurances that future growth will be shared more effectively and equitably, rather than skewed towards one group or one economic layer. Just as that banner said in the headquarters of one of Bill Clinton’s early primary election campaigns, it remains true that “it is the economy, stupid” that underpins an electoral race.

Taken together, these demographic trends: a likely push towards a fairer redistricting of congressional seats to Democratic Party advantage; the potential impact of an inflow of Puerto Rican-Americans from the island to the continental US, and the unequal impact (or perception) of segmented economic growth, all stand a fair chance of reshuffling the electoral deck, come the 2020 general election, or even, perhaps, 2018’s midterm one. Smart politicians are already gaming these trends as best they can; but much will still depend on how well almost certain candidates – and potential candidates eager to test the waters – will be able to convey policy ideas convincingly to an electorate that build on such demographics.

Make no mistake – the next elections are already in the view of such candidates on the part of Democrats as well as Republicans. Differently than in 2016, the GOP will now be forced to stand on Donald Trump’s actual record, as well as all those embarrassing public performances, tweets, and failed or absent appointments. And, of course, he will have to stand or fall on how his administration actually resolves the current North Korean impasse (rather than the idle threats about fire and fury), how he carries out actual economic and trade negotiations with China, and how he deals with the chimera of a silly wall to the south of the country. And if Hurricane Maria turns out to be Trump’s Katrina moment, he will only have himself to blame when it makes Florida a bastion of Democratic voting in the coming electoral cycles.
