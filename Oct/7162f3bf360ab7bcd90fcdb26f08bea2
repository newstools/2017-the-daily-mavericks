       If you need visual proof of the drought in Cape Town the one place you definitely won’t find it is the Spier Wine Estate in Stellenbosch where fountains and streams flow between green lawns and trees bursting with spring leaves. But it’s this very setting where groundwater scientists have gathered to find solutions to the city’s worst drought in more than a century.

But the situation is far removed from fiction. Around this time last year the city’s dams were sitting at 62%. This summer the tourist city is starting its dry season with dams at just 37% full and only 27% of that water is considered usable and safe to drink. The City of Cape Town is frantically trying to drive down usage, urging residents to reduce their water consumption to 87 liters per person per day to stretch the remaining above-ground water supply until March 2018. But the City is also finding alternative water sources to prevent the municipal water supply from running out completely. But the situation is far removed from fiction.

Two months ago, Mayor Patricia de Lille announced the city’s Water Resilience Plan, which is expected to cost R2-billion in capital expenditure to secure an additional 500 megalitres of water a day from a combination of alternative water sources including land-based desalination, reusing waste water and tapping into groundwater. This is where the groundwater specialists come in. Drilling boreholes (sometimes hundreds of metres deep) into aquifers around the city could provide as much as 100 megalitres of the additional 500 megalitres the city is desperate to find.

Parsons says groundwater has been minimally impacted on by the drought, making it a ripe source for much needed water during the drought and that there is an “army of geohydrologists waiting to help”, as much of the research legwork has already been done. But he stresses that the city’s augmentation plan, complete with drawn-out procurement protocols, is holding back what really needs to be done.

Barry Wood, bulk water supply manager from the City of Cape Town, outlined the City’s groundwater plan at the conference on Wednesday. It includes accessing up to 60 megalitres from the Table Mountain Group (TMG) aquifer, up to 8 megalitres from the Atlantis aquifer and 20 megalitres from the Cape Flats aquifer. Wood says we’re already accessing about 10 megalitres per day from the aquifers and they’re hoping to increase that to 100 megalitres over the next few months. But the red tape is thick and the clock to Day Zero is ticking.  Barry Wood, bulk water supply manager from the City of Cape Town, outlined the City’s groundwater plan at the conference on Wednesday.
