As a developing nation, in a rapidly changing global economic and geopolitical context, it is imperative that South Africa must, on an ongoing basis, reflect on the strategic implications these changes have for the manner in which we market, profile and position the Nation Brand. It would be idle of us as a country to assume that existing strategies will continue to deliver results.

For this reason, the 2017 Nation Brand Forum focused on engaging business on the development of the Nation Brand’s global marketing strategy. Essentially aiming to involve business in strengthening, enhancing and advancing the long term reputation and image of the Nation Brand and to advise Brand South Africa on how best the organisation can inspire innovation, and utilise the existing business excellence in the South African context, to better market, profile, and position the Nation Brand in emerging markets.

This strategic forum convened at a critical time in our country’s history when the nation is celebrating the legacy of one of the greatest sons that our struggle has ever produced, Oliver Reginald Tambo. Tambo would have turned a 100 years old on 27 October this year, which is a mere four years younger than the ANC which nurtured his bright ideas and revolutionary consciousness.

As an Internationalist and a campaigner for global solidarity and peace, Tambo contributed in more than one way in the construction of the South African Brand. He was the one who sold the South African dream long before many of us envisioned the democratic dispensation we now enjoy. The Nation Brand delegates were unanimous that alongside Mandela, it was fitting to recognise his role as the foremost brand architect of our new nation and country.

The Nation Brand debate unfolds also when our country is working tirelessly to consolidate its identity as a new nation formed on the bedrock of bitter sacrifices suffered by many, some of whom laid their lives down so that this new nation could be born. That history and heritage defines the essence of our Nation Brand which our counterparts in the developing world and elsewhere should embrace and understand. In addition to everything else, our Nation Brand is in many ways influenced by our heritage and culture.

During the 20th century we were led to believe that globalisation was an open-ended inevitability. However, in the past few years since the global financial crisis, we have seen exactly the opposite happen. Yesteryear’s advocates of globalisation, international trade and business interaction are increasingly closing their borders in fits of economic nationalism and isolationism.

Among many other analyses of these phenomena, Business Monitor International (BMI) indicates that with the rise of populism, right wing movements in Western political jurisdictions, and phenomena such as the Brexit vote, globalisation may have reached a plateau, and that the process may be reversed in some respects.

It is for this reason that analysts indicate that since 2009, data indicates a slowdown of global trade not only as a result of the fall-out of the Global Financial Crisis, but due to increasing protectionism in the so-called advanced/developed economies of the world.

The BRICS nations on the other hand have in a short time proven themselves to be willing, and able, to find solutions for developing nations. For example, the BRICS’s New Development Bank is an example of how developing nations are creating alternative platforms to promote and support internal development beyond Bretton Woods institutions in this post-Washington Consensus world. The Nation Brand’s marketing strategy does not have a choice but to keep up with these rapid developments.

A well-marketed and globally positioned Nation Brand can contribute to attracting investment and aid with market entry strategy by increasing awareness of the country in international markets, while also bringing more tourists, students, and specialised skills to the country. Country development strategies that ultimately aim to build positive Nation Brands should be premised approaches that can help people to adapt their views and to acquire new knowledge and skills, and spread new social messages to large audiences.

Like any developing country and emerging economy, South Africa has a plethora of challenges that continue to confront it and its developmental agenda. Many nations, like South Africa, have diverse societies. And as such, they often are accompanied by a complex set of socio-economic and cultural stratifications. The NDP succinctly outlines these challenges and at the same time, proposes suitable remedies that must be implemented.

It is incontestable that there are major changes and greater emphasis on communications to be more widespread in contributing to the debate for the development of societies for improved nation brands.
