Sirleaf was voted into power in 2005 by the female vote after 14 years of civil war in the country. Liberia has since been at peace.

A friend who worked in the country has told of the special treatment female guests of the president used to receive. Going around schools in the country, the same friend asked a little boy what wanted to be one day. He said although being president is a woman’s job, he’d like to be president too one day. Sweet anecdote, but when it comes to Sirleaf’s actual record of bettering women’s lives, it’s a mixed one.

How about closer to home? Dlamini Zuma already has a track record in government, but it’s been mixed. While as health minister in the 1990s she placed a lot of emphasis on primary healthcare, especially for mothers and children, her siding with sex pest Norman Mashabane in 2006, despite a court finding him guilty, wasn’t the kind of thing you’d expect from someone who calls herself a gender activist.

With her at the helm, the African Union ran a campaign against child marriages and got the buy-in of male presidents, despite it being a very sensitive topic culturally and despite the chauvinism on the continent – a feather in Dlamini Zuma’s gender cap.

Should Dlamini-Zuma be elected president of the ANC it will be against the gender odds. Despite the party having very progressive rules dictating that half of its leadership should be women, this has never filtered through to the most contested positions – that of president, secretary-general, and chairpersons and secretaries at provincial and regional levels.

Women in the party also don’t do well in highly contested situations. The video clips of chairs flying at the Eastern Cape provincial conference last weekend, and the images of injured people emerging, perhaps serve as a good illustration of just how hostile the atmosphere can be. Gender equality doesn’t thrive in violence. The long nights that often characterise party contestation are also not friendly to women who are often the care-givers in their families. If it wants real gender equality, the ANC should address its infighting too (and attitudes have hardened to such an extent that this is unlikely to happen soon).

Anecdotal evidence also suggests that there still is a highly patriarchal culture within the ANC, with many men being averse to having a woman president. Should Dlamini-Zuma actually go on to smash that glass ceiling within the party, is it actually an achievement that could be duplicated soon? It seems unlikely – although in a decade or so the ANC might be out of power anyway, and its presidency would no longer be a big prize.

Also, the fact that Dlamini Zuma is going against ANC traditions – that the deputy president of the party should preferably become the president – might breed resentment in the party, so that when her term as president is up some within the party would cry that they don’t want another woman leader – just as some north African states did when she stepped out after her first term in the AU.

The gender credentials of the campaigners Dlamini Zuma has surrounded herself with are also questionable. Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini earlier this year almost collapsed the social grants system because of maladministration, and has been unapologetic about it. Those that benefit from this system are mostly female and they are all poor.  The gender credentials of the campaigners Dlamini Zuma has surrounded herself with are also questionable.
