Ask DA leader Mmusi Maimane if he’s personally confident that Cape Town won’t run out of water, and he doesn’t hesitate.        Yeah,” Maimane says. “I certainly feel confident enough with the plans they are putting in place – and they must execute against those – that we won’t run out of water.” The only sign of tension in his previously calm body language is that his leg starts to jiggle a bit. Yeah,” Maimane says. “I certainly feel confident enough with the plans they are putting in place – and they must execute against those – that we won’t run out of water.” The only sign of tension in his previously calm body language is that his leg starts to jiggle a bit.   3  3   3 The national DA has had little to say in public recently on the Western Cape’s water crisis, while the situation in the DA’s flagship province and city grows more severe daily.

[The City is] adjudicating on a number of bidders, and part of the problem now with those bidders is that because people recognise the urgency of the situation, there’s been some alleged colluding around price for the provision of desalination plants and [extracting water from] underground, so we have to monitor that,” Maimaine said.

Maimane says that the national Department of Water has been approached to request more funds, and that he will consequently be scrutinising the upcoming medium-term budget closely.

The DA leader has strong criticism of what he says has been a lack of support from national government for the Western Cape’s crisis, with national Minister Nomvula Mokonyane having previously cancelled meetings to address the problem. It isn’t a subject he is particularly interested in dwelling on – he believes that “citizens aren’t inspired by blame” – but he suspects that some of national government’s lack of interest in engaging with the province’s water crisis is motivated by political ill-feeling.

When you want to put a desalination plant in Mouille Point, for example, the Mouille Point Business Forum gets together and says, ‘It will hinder our view’, or whatever the case may be. So they put in an objection. Do you then break the law, and ignore public sentiment, to move on to other issues?” When you want to put a desalination plant in Mouille Point, for example, the Mouille Point Business Forum gets together and says, ‘It will hinder our view’, or whatever the case may be.

Beyond this, consumer behaviour is often beyond the control of local government. Cape Town has still not succeeded in lowering its consumption to the necessary target of 500-million litres per day.
