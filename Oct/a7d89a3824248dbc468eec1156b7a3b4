For the plan to succeed, Herron said the city needs to take over all the assets required to provide the service.

He said the city estimates that it will need “hundreds of millions of rands” in the short-to-medium term to restore the passenger rail to a fully functional and effective service. In a press conference earlier this month, Herron said the city would need R20-million for the planning stage.
