It’s hard to tell whether the two leading ANC presidential hopefuls, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and MP Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, deliberately planned to be in each others’ home provinces at the same time this weekend.        What is clear from Dlamini Zuma’s side, however, is that her rally to the Moreku Senior Secondary school in Mohlarekoma (near Jane Furse) in the hilly and rural Sekhukhune region of Limpopo had some intent of striking at the heart of the opposite faction: about 10km from the school is the home of provincial ANC chairperson Stan Mathabatha, a staunch Ramaphosa supporter. The region is said to be evenly divided between the camps.

Provincial and local #CR17Siyavuma campaigners gathered in a rival event at the same time as Dlamini Zuma’s about 20km away from Mohlarekoma, but because Ramaphosa was in KwaZulu-Natal at the time, they didn’t have a headline act and the gathering was perhaps just a way of telling the others: “We see you.” Provincial and local #CR17Siyavuma campaigners gathered in a rival event at the same time as Dlamini Zuma’s about 20km away from Mohlarekoma, but because Ramaphosa was in KwaZulu-Natal at the time, they didn’t have a headline act and the gathering was perhaps just a way of telling the others: “We see you.”        Dlamini Zuma supporters put the provincial support at about 60% to 40% in her favour, while Ramaphosa supporters see these figures inverted, at the very least. Dlamini Zuma supporters put the provincial support at about 60% to 40% in her favour, while Ramaphosa supporters see these figures inverted, at the very least.        ANC people in Limpopo reckon Ramaphosa’s support in his home region of the former Venda is actually quite weak, and that he derives his strength from other regions in the province. On the same score, President Jacob Zuma’s home municipality of Nkandla has never been his strongest support base, and has even fallen to the IFP during the height of his power, so this might mean nothing at all at a national level.

Whereas Dlamini Zuma bused in supporters from five regions in the province and filled two medium-sized marquees luxuriously carpeted with fake grass, Malema addressed the learners in a square between the classrooms.

Dlamini Zuma’s visit also reminds of Zuma’s occasional campaigning in the province in the run-up to the ANC’s contested 2007 Polokwane conference, down to the meetings with the traditional leaders but minus, perhaps, the burning of imphepho (sacred herbs) and the singing of struggle songs like Mshini Wami.

Dlamini Zuma was dressed in ANC Women’s League regalia: sensible shoes, a sensible black skirt, bright green blouse and bright green pashmina shawl that was so long it reached the ground – a mark of acknowledging that the event was organised mainly by the women’s league. Its president, Bathabile Dlamini, was also in attendance. ANC Youth League leader Collen Maine, who has been scarce of late, was there as well, almost hiding underneath his cap and behind a flower arrangement on the table, quite the opposite of Umkhonto we Sizwe Veterans’ Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus, who was vocally out there and occasionally seen putting his arm around the shoulders of fellow women comrades.

The interesting part of her speech, given that she was delivering it in a province where she spoke none of the languages (her speech was in English, while the sometimes restless crowd consisted mostly of Sepedi and Ndebele speakers), was on tribalism and social cohesion.

Perhaps this wasn’t so much a reference to the rise of Zulu nationalism – and tribalism more generally – under Zuma’s rise and reign as it was a plea for those in the province not to support Ramaphosa just because he was “one of them”.

The lack of even development could also start conflicts, she said. “That’s why we must make sure the economy of this country is conferred to the majority of the people, that the status quo does not continue, because it is not sustainable. But also, if we continue like this, how do you think we will have a stable South Africa when we continue to build an army of unemployed young people and of the poor,” she said.

She also took selfies with Niehaus and anyone else who cared to pose.
