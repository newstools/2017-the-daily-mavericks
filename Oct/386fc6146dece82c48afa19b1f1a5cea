  3  3   3 In a judgment scathing of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s conduct and “somewhat unrepentant alignment with one side of the public debate”, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria in mid-August set aside one remedial action, that justice committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga must bring about a constitutional change to redefine the role of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB).

In a judgment scathing of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s conduct and “somewhat unrepentant alignment with one side of the public debate”, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria in mid-August set aside one remedial action, that justice committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga must bring about a constitutional change to redefine the role of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB).    1  1   1 That remedial action went as far as outlining the wording that must be used to amend the current Section 224 of the Constitution so the SARB is responsible for “ensuring that the socio-economic well-being of the citizens are protected” and “to achieve meaningful socio-economic transformation”. Currently the SARB’s primary objective is “to protect the value of the currency in the interest of balanced and sustainable economic growth”.

While this specific remedial action was successfully taken on review to court on an urgent basis by SARB, the ABSA Bankorp report remains under court review for a number of other issues including, according to court documents, on grounds of irrationality, and failure to disclose investigative development to affected parties, like Mkhwebane’s engagements with President Jacob Zuma’s lawyers and the State Security Agency (SSA).

When that Absa Bankorp report was released in June 2017, the exchange rate dipped, wiping out over a billion rand in stocks, amid widespread concern it was part of efforts to tamper with the SARB’s institutional independence. The report came amid ANC policy conference radical economic transformation discussions that ultimately recommended the SARB should be nationalised, while retaining independence. The ANC December national elective conference will decide on whether the bank’s private shareholders would be bought out.

A point of order that the public protector’s integrity could not be questioned without a substantial motion was brought by ANC MP Loyiso Mpumlwana – “To us all you are a very good example of a public protector,” he also said – and upheld by acting justice committee chairperson ANC MP Chana Pilane-Majake.

The basis of this finding remains unclear as Malunga publicly confirmed he had renounced Zimbabwean citizenship in line with South African legislative requirements.
