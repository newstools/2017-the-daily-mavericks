On a rainy night in February 2014, Duduzane Zuma crashed into a taxi on the M1 in Johannesburg. The accident led to the death of Phumzile Dube. During a 2014 inquest, the young Zuma said he drove through a puddle that led his Porsche to collide with the taxi. The magistrate ruled that there was a prima facie case that his negligent actions caused Dube’s death. The NPA reviewed the evidence and said it wouldn’t prosecute.

When Phumzile Dube was killed her daughter was just two years old. She is now five and the family cannot afford to send her to creche.

First, they require a nolle prosequi certificate from the NPA stating that the prosecuting authority has officially declined to prosecute a matter. Second, they must include a private individual with a substantial interest in the case that can prove they suffered an injury from the alleged crime. Such prosecutions also cost money, including a potentially substantial deposit that will be lost if the case fails. While it might be difficult for Nel to tick all the boxes to charge government officials for corruption – considering the need to find individuals directly affected – AfriForum probably decided to target Duduzane Zuma for a reason.

The president’s son certainly has resources.

When he slammed into the taxi on that wet Johannesburg night, the first person he called wasn’t his father, the president of the country, but Rajesh “Tony” Gupta, one of the family members paying him R300,000 a month in director fees, who won his family millions in contracts, and who helped him buy an R18-million apartment in Dubai.
