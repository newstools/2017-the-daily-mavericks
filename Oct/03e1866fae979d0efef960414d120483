       First published by ISS Today        Ghana is poised to become the first African country, and the first country outside of Europe and the Americas, to decriminalise the personal possession and use of all illegal drugs.         Ghana’s Narcotics Control Commission Bill, 2017 (the “Narcotics Bill”), which will repeal and replace existing drug offences, is expected to be passed later this year. The proposed legislation seeks to address drug use as a ‘public health issue’.         Implementing it would mark a significant departure departure        Under the new Narcotics Bill, a person who commits the offence of “possession or control of a narcotic drug for use” will face civil, instead of criminal, penalties in the form of a fine. Imprisonment and the minimum 10-year sentence will apply only in the cases of those convicted of trafficking (that is – when someone is found to be in “the possession or control of a quantity of a narcotic drug in excess of a quantity which can reasonably be used by an individual in a day”).         The new bill will also lead to the creation of a Narcotics Control Commission, with prescribed statutory objectives to co-ordinate the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts, and also to ensure that drug addiction is treated as a public health issue.        West Africa, as a region, has become a key transit hub for drug traffickers. Domestic drug use has spiked and prisons are overflowing. This seismic change in Ghana’s approach to drug policy recognises that the current punitive legislative approach has not been successful.        There is a general groundswell of support for the new legislation. In a speech speech        The outcome of Ghana’s legislative shift will be watched closely in other African countries, and will no doubt affect responses to drug trafficking and associated organised crime.         In South Africa, a recent landmark case  landmark case  National Drug Masterplan statement        Reflecting the complexity of the global drug policy debate, however, there appears to be a lack of consensus within the South African government as to the way forward. While progressive policies have been outlined and are being debated, the current court case on cannabis decriminalisation is itself vigorously opposed by the state.        This suggests that, going forward, it will be important to observe how rhetoric and legislative reform translates into action on the ground. Developments in Ghana should be closely watched in this respect.         Ghana’s proposed legislation has been praised for its focus on the rehabilitation of drug users, where it encourages them to seek treatment. However, as is the case across most of the continent, Ghana has only a limited number of drug rehabilitation facilities. The vast majority of these are run privately or by religious institutions and offer only limited support services.         Achieving a genuine reduction in the harm caused by drug use will require a great deal more investment, alternative resource allocation, infrastructure development and capacity building – not least for clinics, rehabilitation centres, medical personnel and social workers – in those areas most affected by drug use. It remains to be seen whether the required resources for effective implementation of this policy innovation will be made available.
