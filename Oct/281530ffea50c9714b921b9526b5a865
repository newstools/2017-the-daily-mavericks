       Okay here’s a quick literary pop quiz for all you really smart, well-read folks. What do authors Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky, Ibsen, Strindberg, Zola, Proust, Kafka, Rilke, Brecht, Croce, Hardy, Henry James, Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, DH Lawrence, and García Lorca all have in common?

What do authors Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky, Ibsen, Strindberg, Zola, Proust, Kafka, Rilke, Brecht, Croce, Hardy, Henry James, Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, DH Lawrence, and García Lorca all have in common?         Answer: although they were all very much alive once the Nobel Prizes for Literature were under way (first award was in 1901), none of those worthies got the nod from the executors of Alfred Nobel’s estate and the committee set up to administer the awards selection.  Answer: although they were all very much alive once the Nobel Prizes for Literature were under way (first award was in 1901), none of those worthies got the nod from the executors of Alfred Nobel’s estate and the committee set up to administer the awards selection.         While that list above didn’t make the cut, worthies such as Sully Prudhomme, José Echegaray, Rudolf Eucken, Paul von Heyse, Verner von Heidenstam, Wladyslaw Reymont, Grazia Deledda, Erik A. Karlfeldt, Frans Sillanpää, and Halldór Laxness all did. As baseball great and sports humourist Yogi Berra used to say about such things, “You could look it up.” While that list above didn’t make the cut, worthies such as Sully Prudhomme, José Echegaray, Rudolf Eucken, Paul von Heyse, Verner von Heidenstam, Wladyslaw Reymont, Grazia Deledda, Erik A.

Well, the Nobel Prize’s own website says:  What do the arrangements for the prize actually call for? Well, the Nobel Prize’s own website says:         Among the five prizes provided for in Alfred Nobel’s will (1895), one was intended for the person who, in the literary field, had produced ‘the most outstanding work in an ideal direction’. [Italics added] The Laureate should be determined by ‘the Academy in Stockholm’, which was specified by the statutes of the Nobel Foundation to mean the Swedish Academy. These statutes defined literature as ‘not only belles-lettres, but also other writings which, by virtue of their form and style, possess literary value’. At the same time, the restriction to works presented ‘during the preceding year’ was softened: ‘older works’ could be considered ‘if their significance has not become apparent until recently’.”  Among the five prizes provided for in Alfred Nobel’s will (1895), one was intended for the person who, in the literary field, had produced ‘the most outstanding work in an ideal direction’.

What did Nobel actually mean by ideal? In fact, the history of the Literature Prize appears as a series of attempts to interpret an imprecisely worded will. The consecutive phases in that history reflect the changing sensibility of an academy continuously renewing itself.

The Nobel Prize website divides the awards into several distinct historical periods, since 1901. In sequence, thematically, these have included, first, recognition of a “Lofty and Sound Idealism”. Thereafter, the themes were a “Sense of Neutrality” during World War I, then the “Great Style” epoch of the 1920s, followed by more “Universal Interest”. And that was followed by “The Pioneers” (setting out a new literary agenda after the Second World War), followed by a closer “Attention to Unknown Masters”, and then, finally, “The Literature of the Whole World”, from 1986 onwards.

Later practice shows the extension to Nadine Gordimer from South Africa, to Kenzaburo Oe from Japan, to Derek Walcott from St Lucia in the West Indies, to Toni Morrison, the first Afro-American on the list, and to Gao Xingjian, the first laureate to write in Chinese.” On the last category, the Prize’s website observed, “the Academy’s Eurocentric policy was also significantly altered by the choices of Wole Soyinka from Nigeria in 1986 and Naguib Mahfouz from Egypt in 1988.

If so, how long will it be before a filmmaker such as Ridley Scott, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, or someone even younger, and working in the most advanced possible multimedia space, is eventually given the nod?

In the meantime, before we have that putative electronic media awardee or even just a run-of-the-mill filmmaker, this year’s winner was the Japanese-British (or is it British-Japanese?) novelist Kazuo Ishiguro. Born in Japan, but brought to the UK as a small child, where he grew up, he may probably be best known to the world as the writer of his novel, The Remains of the Day. Truthfully, his fame grew further by virtue of that wonderful cinematic treatment of Ishiguro’s novel, starring Anthony Hopkins as a just-retired butler who has seen and heard pretty much everything during his service on a major landed estate. In doing this job, he has forgone the possibility of a romantic tie. Then, finally, in his solitary retirement, he drives through Britain, trying to figure out what his life has meant after all this duty, sadness and disappointment.

There is no doubt that Ishiguro is a fine choice, although there certainly were other reasonable claimants for this year’s brass ring. These would have included the prolific Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami, American novelist Philip Roth, and Kenyan man of letters Ngugi wa Thiong’o, just to name a few. The Nobel Prize rules also dictate that the winners must be alive in the year of their awards and so those three men (aged 68, 84, and 79 respectively) are certainly not getting any younger and the time of their consideration is soon, surely.

But there is one other name that almost certainly should have been given the nod years ago. And that, of course, is South Africa’s Athol Fugard. Here, too, is a creative genius in the final chapters of his life, and now at the age of 85 he seems to bear a special worthiness for this prize.

Almost right from the start of his career as a playwright with works like The Blood Knot and Boesman and Lena, Fugard’s output has been performed globally to extraordinary acclaim. Whether he was the solo author, or where he collaborated closely in the creative process with actors John Kani and Winston Ntshonga (such as with Sizwe Banzi is Dead and The Island), the vast body of Fugard’s work has focused laser-like on the creation of messages that, as the Nobel Prize stipulations say, are in “an ideal direction”. Consider, for example, such plays as My Children! My Africa! or Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act for that reach towards “the ideal”.

All clear? Let us get some professors of literature to get that nomination in, in time, in full, in-depth. Maybe we should even send a set of all Fugard’s plays and published essays, as well as the films that have been done from some of them. And maybe there should be a few testimonial letters from some other globally regarded theatre people as well. If nominators need some help, they can let me know, but time’s a-wasting.

In American baseball, for the game’s stars, five years after they retire, their names can be considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame. But sometimes the contemporary view of who was a “great” needs to be rethought after the passage of decades. That’s why the Hall of Fame has a veterans committee that evaluates much older possible candidates for a second or third look. They can even be players who are deceased but whose achievements really should be acknowledged by admission into that baseball shrine in Cooperstown, New York.  Oh, and one other thing.

What about a veterans committee that could evaluate the achievements of the Tolstoys, the Chekhovs, the Gorkys, and so forth – and recommend them for posthumous awards and recognition by the Nobel franchise, even if not the money that comes with the certificate. While they’re at it, maybe they could also take a look at the genius of the sadly overlooked writer, Stephan Zweig, as well.  So, how about it, Nobel Prize organisers?

Here was a writer who understood the nature of imperialism from inside the beast when he first broke through with his astounding essays and a splendid first novel. He then made understanding of the lives of the European poor impossible to ignore with several non-fiction novels. Unwilling to stay as an observer, he personally fought fascism in Spain and then quickly penned the greatest book to come out of that struggle. Later in life, before he died in the prime of his writing life from TB, he found a way to dissect the future of state tyranny. In the process, he coined a phrase that has become the watchword for the fear of the coming crushing of liberty – “Big Brother”. Surely he too deserves a look, finally?
