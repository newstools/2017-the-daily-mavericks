As Africa’s population ages, the ratio between workers and dependants will improve – leading to a potential boost in productivity and economic growth. However, Africa’s poorer economies are several decades away from experiencing a demographic dividend – and more importantly, most lack the necessary investments in human capital and job creation to capitalise on it.

On the current trajectory, population growth is likely to compound poverty in sub-Saharan Africa as it is outpacing economic growth (see Figure 1).

Overall, African economies need to grow much faster and make more strategic investments in human capital to reduce poverty, improve development outcomes and build adequate infrastructure.         Where will this growth come from? Much of Africa is likely to remain vulnerable to global shocks. Its oil and metal exporters will continue to be the most exposed to global price volatility. Growth in non-hydrocarbon-dependent economies – energy importers and agricultural exporters – is likely to remain stable. Current and expected growth rates for some of Africa’s agricultural exporters are in line with Asia’s fastest-growing economies. Where will this growth come from?

Africa’s ability to participate more in regional and global trade partly depends on improving transportation and trade infrastructure and streamlining regulations. That said, a strategy to connect Africa must also include investment in basic infrastructure, such as access to clean water, electricity and improved sanitation. These services are key components of productivity and hence growth.
