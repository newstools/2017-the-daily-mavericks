       Two months had passed after Tholakele “Bhele” Dlunga survived the Marikana Massacre when five plainclothes policemen knocked down the door to his shack. The rock drill operator from Lonmin’s Karee 4 Belt helped organise workers in the lead-up to the 2012 strike and was elected one of the leaders of the strike committee. The police had photos of other leaders and wanted to know their whereabouts. They tortured Bhele for days, first at home, then at the police station.

In the aftermath of that massacre, miners were even more suspicious of journalists than usual and they had a similar, heightened awareness on Wednesday. “It’s like they’re on schedule, every week,” an Amcu member said of the recent killings.

As the sun set, Amcu President Joseph Mathunjwa defended his union and slammed reports claiming the killings stem from internal divisions. In the years before 2012, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) dominated the mining sector, but as leaders failed to deliver significant gains for workers or succumbed to the benefits that come with taking office, the union started to fracture. Divisions reigned. Opponents were killed.  As the sun set, Amcu President Joseph Mathunjwa defended his union and slammed reports claiming the killings stem from internal divisions.

The Marikana Massacre ended NUM’s dominance in the platinum belt and the various worker formations that had emerged joined Amcu, making it the biggest union in the sector. The media reports that Mathunjwa spent so much time on – he even called out journalists by name – suggest Amcu could be following NUM’s descent, becoming defined by an undemocratic leadership that resolves divisions with bullets rather than discussions.

Mathunjwa hates to read the word, as we realised in a press conference on Thursday, but “sources” speaking to Daily Maverick and reported in other publications say divisions are the cause of the violence. A key incident appears to be the dismissal or suspension of Amcu officials by Lonmin in July after one union official allegedly got illegal access to another’s computer and he and his supporters were sidelined.

As yet, sources won’t go on record – the bodies are piling up and a hit list is rumoured to have been sent to assassins – and Mathunjwa was critical of reports tarnishing him and the union without named sources, clear facts or comments from Amcu leaders.

He criticised the lack of police action on the killings and announced that Amcu would offer a R100,000 reward for any information leading to a successful conviction. The union said it has contracted well-known private investigator Paul O’Sullivan to investigate the killings and has requested a meeting with Police Minister Fikile Mbalula. If Amcu leaders were involved, asked Mathunjwa, why would they push for an investigation and offer a reward that could implicate them?
