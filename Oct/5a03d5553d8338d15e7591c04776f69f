       When writing about politicians it is important to be fair, to include both the perceived positives and negatives about a person. Someone like Manto Tshabalala-Msimang allowed hundreds of thousands of people to die through her attitude to ARVs, yet devoted her life to helping liberate her fellow South Africans.

In Parliament he oversaw the jamming of cellphones in 2015. A month later he claimed that then Public Protector Advocate Thuli Madonsela might be a spy for the CIA. He then claimed that a leader of the student #FeesMustFall protests, Mcebo Dlamini, had been to his house several times. Then he said he hadn’t. He has claimed government knew for a year in advance that there would be violent protests in Vuwani but appeared to do nothing to prevent them. And then, Al Jazeera aired footage showing that he had visited a brothel. The brothel was owned by someone who happens to smuggle rhino horn for a living.

Well, dear reader, if you want to judge a person by the company they keep, one should look no further than these two.

At the same time, one must consider what is really at stake here. Despite Mahlobo’s denials, the only people (apart from the obvious corruption it would involve) who stand to benefit from the nuclear deal are the Russians. Their leader, Vladimir Putin, is prepared to play dirty to get what he wants. The US has seen claim after substantiated claim that Putin was meddling in the elections that brought Donald Trump to the White House. Alexander Litvinenko was murdered through radioactive poisoning in London. Why would we be surprised that he is not prepared to interfere in South Africa's political processes?

The fact that Mahlobo is still in the government is in itself an indication of how low the ANC appears to have sunk. And the fact that Luthuli House was not even consulted about his appointment, and appears powerless to do anything about it, reveals the power relationship at the moment. In short, it could be argued that Zuma has essentially left the ANC, and is now operating on his own.

There is many a speculation about the possibility of authoritarianism in our future, and that Zuma may try to follow the examples of Putin, or Turkey's Recep Erdoğan. However, both of those leaders are far more popular than their respective parties. They have populations in thrall to them, and their individual statures almost overshadow the parties themselves. Here, surely the opposite is true. The ANC is much more popular than Zuma. This means that should the party turn on him, he has nowhere to turn. And thus it all becomes, once again, about what will happen in December. This is an important point.
