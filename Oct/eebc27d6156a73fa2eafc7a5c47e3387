Holtzman has been on suspension for longer than she’s been at work as PPS boss, a job for which she was head hunted.         In the first half of 2015 word emerged that Secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana repeatedly had requested official transport, with blue lights, for himself and relatives. When Holtzman and her deputy Motlatsi Mokgatla were put on precautionary suspension on 30 July 2015 the parliamentary grapevine buzzed with the soured relationship between Mgidlana and Holtzman and Mokgatla over the blue lights and moves to recruit SAPS officials to the PPS. Mgidlana has dismissed claims of wrongdoing.

In mid-2016 it became public that she had been found guilty on four of the 12 charges – gross insubordination, insubordination, failing to resolve tensions in the PPS and failure to submit a business plan.

It is understood there was a separate process to try to settle the matter.

Parliament announced its decision to fire Holtzman on Wednesday.        This week the Right2Know Campaign (R2K) said it was convinced “attempts to dismiss Holtzman are ‘punishment’ after she blew the whistle against abuse of state resources”, citing concerns over Mgidlana’s “unauthorised use of ‘blue light’ vehicles and the securitisation of Parliament through the recruitment of police” to the PPS. “Parliament must respect whistle-blowers. In this country we have normalised corruption so much that we see outrageous attacks on whistle-blowers – from corruption-busting municipal officials to whistle-blowers, who act against corporate crime,” said R2K, also highlighting the “mysterious” theft of Holtzman’s documents from her lawyer’s office that contained evidence of possible financial mismanagement.

On Thursday Holtzman said she is not taking her dismissal lying down, and has decided to contest not only the sanctions, but also the guilty verdicts. This includes recommended dismissal for the failure to submit a business plan, which Holtzman maintained, was not her performance contract. She did what was required of her -- and submitted a budget and strategic and annual performance plans for the PPS. “It’s not like I was sitting on my hands.” On Thursday Holtzman said she is not taking her dismissal lying down, and has decided to contest not only the sanctions, but also the guilty verdicts.

She did what was required of her -- and submitted a budget and strategic and annual performance plans for the PPS. “It’s not like I was sitting on my hands.”        The insubordination counts, for which dismissal also was recommended, obliquely related to the blue lights issue, but specifically to a failure to answer five questions from Deputy Secretary to Parliament (DSTP) Baby Tyawa. According to City Press, she had been asked by Mgidlana to inquire whether he was entitled to official transport. The findings of the independent disciplinary inquiry, seen by Daily Maverick, indicate it did not deal with evidence by Holtzman that by late July 2015 she was no longer responsible for “driving services” as this function was removed from PPS to Household Services, another division in Parliament’s administration. “(Holtzman), if indeed she was no longer in charge of driving services – could simply have informed the DSTP in response to the request,” it said upholding the gross insubordination and insubordination guilty verdicts.

On Thursday Holtzman pointed out that aside from steps taken against her, there have been no consequences. “The only thing he (Mgidlana) has done is to ensure he’s set in motion a process to get rid of me.” And this, she argues, is part of a concerning development – “what I call tyrannical” – across public administration and the state.

Controls are used through administrative instructions to deflect from the real issues, from the transformation that should happen, from the delivery of services,” said Holtzman, also raising concerns over the securatisation of Parliament and democracy. “The way they utilised the white shirts and deployed serving police officers is actually problematic.” Controls are used through administrative instructions to deflect from the real issues, from the transformation that should happen, from the delivery of services,” said Holtzman, also raising concerns over the securatisation of Parliament and democracy. “The way they utilised the white shirts and deployed serving police officers is actually problematic.”        It’s not that Parliament should not be secured, but the way this is being done in a democracy, she added.

The “white shirts”, or “bouncers”, is how the SAPS recruits into the PPS are colloquially known on and off the parliamentary precinct. Their role in evicting unruly MPs, usually the EFF, has meant scrutiny of them since recruitment, officially as chamber support staff, although they also attend committee meetings and accompany MPs on oversight visits.

After the SAPS members were recruited to the PPS in 2015 - at the time there was much talk within Parliament to boost security given disruptions in the House that also sparked a review of the rules - 72 long-serving PPS staff lodged a labour grievance.

Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo on Thursday said there was no further comment to make on this matter. “(Parliament) considers it closed having gone through a thorough, just and fair process that was headed by an independent and disinterested chairperson,” said Mothapo. “ Ms Holtzman is fully aware of legal remedies/recourse, if unsatisfied with the process.” Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo on Thursday said there was no further comment to make on this matter. “(Parliament) considers it closed having gone through a thorough, just and fair process that was headed by an independent and disinterested chairperson,” said Mothapo. “ Ms Holtzman is fully aware of legal remedies/recourse, if unsatisfied with the process.” Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo on Thursday said there was no further comment to make on this matter. “(Parliament) considers it closed having gone through a thorough, just and fair process that was headed by an independent and disinterested chairperson,” said Mothapo. “ Ms Holtzman is fully aware of legal remedies/recourse, if unsatisfied with the process.”        Holtzman’s dismissal came as Mgidlana awaits the outcome of Parliament’s internal audit committee probe into various claims of mismanagement, including the blue lights, travel and bursary award, after an official complaint by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu).
