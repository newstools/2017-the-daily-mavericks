He thinks it makes riveting reading. It’s the erotic material he keeps  by the bed at night by the bed at night by the bed at night . . .        No civilised community of humans has ever existed without a tax collection mechanism. Indeed, hate these institutions as much as you want, but taxation, security, and rule of law form the essence of a functioning state. KPMG aided in a targeted attempt to hobble SARS or, rather, tried to reconstitute it as another political weapon in the Zuma faction’s arsenal, which was soon to contain the entirety of the security services, and much of what enables rule of law. In other words, KPMG has contributed to the destruction of the South African state, a highly profitable enterprise that was not just unethical, but ipso facto treasonous.

Corporate South Africa tends to perv over the Chinese because “they get things done”. One of the things they’d “get done” is throwing in jail every last person associated with the KPMG/SARS file. And then forget where they hid the keys. Corporate South Africa tends to perv over the Chinese because “they get things done”.

But capital punishment is not a thing here, and we're discussing rule of law – or in this particular case, how professional values adhere within a rule-less vacuum. Indeed, Gordhan, who was far too polite during his panel statements, went on to ask a larger, more pertinent question: But capital punishment is not a thing here, and we're discussing rule of law – or in this particular case, how professional values adhere within a rule-less vacuum.

Abedian, however, took this question to its logical conclusion. His face melting in disgust, he said that “the KPMG SARS report is as low as an auditing firm can go. They’ve put an atomic bomb through their values. [But] you can’t steal a modern economy if you don’t have professional infrastructure around you. Lawyers, chartered accountants, auditors.”  The simple answer is that they were aiding and abetting. Abedian, however, took this question to its logical conclusion.

Indeed, clever whites and clever blacks are continually trumping excellence excellence excellence, as if South Africa is a meritocracy, and as if being an excellent chartered accountant or a lawyer or an actuary – you know, holding up the Standards – will be enough to forestall the apocalypse. And yet it’s “excellence” that’s undone us, because professional values are bankrupt, and the execution of excellence is indistinguishable from rank incompetence. South Africa has been undone by crooks like Zuma, sure. But his best soldiers were the country’s best and brightest, the guys and gals in the power suits, with their fancy degrees and their fancy cars – enablers like local Goldman Sachs chief Colin Coleman and other big brand execs, some of which now have the audacity to berate Zuma for his transgressions, simply because he fired several of their preferred finance ministers.

And so we must chuck the snakes off the plane, all of them. There’s concern that the big banks will be short an auditor if KPMG is wiped away from the bottom of Africa, but fuck that. They’ll make a plan. As for lost jobs, it’s not like Arthur Andersen’s 24,000 former employees are pushing shopping carts around America. Nope, it’s time to break the cartel. If we do so – if we scorch the earth and treat this as a proper economic battlefield – it may hasten the end of the system, or entrench us deeper in the interregnum. We cannot know.

That said, a message needs to be sent to the incoming leadership – your old co-conspirators are dead. South Africa’s wisest and best educated citizens were once thought of as our salvation, and that can again be true – they’ll model the pinstriped pajamas our leaders will soon be wearing. If we accept nothing but full disclosure and the severest of penalties – if we ignore the mealy mouthed pleas for financial sector stability while townships burn – then we begin to break the unbroken culture of impunity that has destroyed this country.
