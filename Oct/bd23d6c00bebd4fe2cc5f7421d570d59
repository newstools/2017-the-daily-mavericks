Makgothi accused the military chiefs of overruling the SADC heads of state who had decided on the deployment of the force by 1 November, at a summit in Pretoria on 15 September. He expressed concern that rebellious soldiers might resist the arrest of officers like Kamoli, if the SADC force was not present in Lesotho.
