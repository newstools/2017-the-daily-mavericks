  42  42   42 When the KPMG International statement was first released on 15 September 2017, the overall first impression was that here was a company coming clean and putting its hand up and being accountable. However, as the dust has settled, it seems that there is a distinct possibility that its intentions are anything but a whole-hearted mea culpa. Let’s review the content fairly.

However, as the dust has settled, it seems that there is a distinct possibility that its intentions are anything but a whole-hearted mea culpa. Let’s review the content fairly.   13  13   13 The KPMG International media statement is revealing not only for what it concedes and addresses, but also for the important issues which appear to have been conveniently overlooked. An analysis of its contents appears to confirm significant spin and obfuscation, suggesting the worst kind of corporate arrogance; especially coming from a major audit firm. The statement, which would no doubt have been carefully crafted under the watchful eyes of legal experts, appears to have worsened the situation as opposed to providing the balm for what has become a major corporate crisis.

It follows then that a registered auditor will have breached statute if he or she has been found guilty of improper conduct by the IRBA and it is worth noting that under certain circumstances, the APA’s penalties provide for fines and/or jail time.

On the matter of tax, the international firm’s findings are that KPMG SA has not been complicit in any advice on offshore structures which could be illegal or improper. Yet, it fails to acknowledge that the KPMG experts were centrally involved in the structuring of a number of business entities in Dubai, including the one trading in precious metals. Finally, the statement confirms that KPMG International has found no evidence of dishonest or unethical behaviour on the part of the audit partners or teams working on the Gupta group of companies. Curiously, the statement makes no finding in this regard on the forensic work of partners and teams involved with the SARS report.

It also seems that the local firm has easily satisfied many of the other requirements for further charges of improper conduct as set out by the IRBA.

However, unethical conduct, as it relates to business, is defined as (i) lacking in moral principles; (ii) unwilling to adhere to proper rules of conduct and; (iii) not conducting business in accordance with the standards of a profession.

Curiously, the senior partners at KPMG SA have publicly acknowledged that their conduct was unwise and improper, and that their audit work was poor, if not outright shoddy. Not only have the top 10 of KPMG SA resigned, but the audit of the “wedding planner firm” was simply in breach of the established norms of the profession. How KPMG International can make no findings at all as to the ethics of the employees involved with the SARS report is indeed passing strange.

Serious as this reality may be, the full KPMG damage is not limited to the audit profession either. It is no exaggeration to argue that KPMG has caused considerable consternation and risk within the business sector in general. The firm’s unethical and improper conduct has in effect made itself, knowingly or otherwise, an accessory to the complex web of fiscal extraction and misappropriation, institutional decay, and material damage to brand SA. None of these is yet acknowledged by the firm.
