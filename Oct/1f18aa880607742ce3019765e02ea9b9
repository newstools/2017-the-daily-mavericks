       First published by ISS Today        Just when the ancient Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo)/Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) quarrel was showing some signs of being resolved, a new armed group has popped up from nowhere this month to launch several armed and deadly attacks in the north. These are believed to be the first Islamist attacks in Mozambique and have caused shock and bewilderment in the country and the region.

According to the Shabelle Media Network in Mogadishu, a group of about 30 men attacked three police stations in the small town of Mocímboa da Praia in the northern-most province of Cabo Delgado, about 30 km from the Tanzania border, early on 5 October.

He said two police officers were shot dead, and two gang members were captured. According to other reports, 16 people died, including a community leader.

Further clashes were reported by independent sources during the night of 22 October at a village called Columbe, about 16km south of an installation of Texas-based Anadarko Petroleum Corporation which is exploring for oil and natural gas there.

Whether they call themselves this too, or whether it’s because of their headgear and what they reportedly told locals after occupying Mocímboa da Praia – that they rejected state health and education and refused to pay taxes – is not yet clear.

But Dina cast doubt on this interpretation from the start, as he said they spoke in local languages including Swahili and Portuguese. There now seems to be consensus that they are local Muslims.

The Muslim faith was originally discouraged by the ruling Frelimo party in its Marxism-Leninist phase. But after it shifted to multi-party democracy in the early 1990s, this policy changed and all faiths were tolerated – if only to avoid alienating potential voters.

The local al-Shabaab – like  Boko Haram Boko Haram Boko Haram  in northern Nigeria – evidently objects to Western-style education, and particularly to boys and girls being taught in the same classroom, some observers say. For Frelimo, on the other hand, boys and girls should be taught together. Anything less would be tantamount to discrimination.  in northern Nigeria – evidently objects to Western-style education, and particularly to boys and girls being taught in the same classroom, some observers say.

Most Mozambican Muslims follow the mystic Sufi school rather than the harder-line Wahhabi sect. The Wahhabis have nonetheless gained greater political and economic influence.

They had been arrested for mining without permits near the Montepuez ruby mine.
