The top four in each conference play off in their conference finals. The winner of each conference (and a wild card if there are only three conferences) play off for the World Championship. It sounds almost too logical to believe. In their vision, each conference will consist of 10 teams who play each other home and away across the season.

The pair hope that they can get administrators’ attention by creating a “groundswell” of people at grassroots to put pressure on administrators so that either the administrators change or the way the game is run changes. They’ve made some progress with Sanzaar, who have agreed to a meeting next year, but Levy feels the urgency is lacking.

It’s comparable to Kodak. The company was the first to develop a digital camera, but effectively gave the technology away out of fear that it would cannibalise its photographic film business. Kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film and there was little incentive to deviate from the traditional course. You know how this story ends. Consumers began moving away from film and Kodak started to struggle. It’s comparable to Kodak.

The way the Pro14 has welcomed South African sides to the competition makes “absolute sense”, says Levy, and he believes that the two sides – the Kings and the Cheetahs – could very well become financial powerhouses of South African rugby as a result of the revenue generated from the competition.
