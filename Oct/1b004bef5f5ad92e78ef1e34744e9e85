T        Consent has always been the biggest issue and missing ingredient to the union when it comes to ukuthwala, but to their tormentors, the girls’ silence means consent. It is against this backdrop that the taking of girls against their will is condemned for being barbaric, outdated and degrading.

It is against this backdrop that the taking of girls against their will is condemned for being barbaric, outdated and degrading.        In terms of the custom a young girl is given in marriage to the family of the male partner, usually in exchange for cash and goods. Ukuthwala is still practised in some parts of rural KZN and in the Eastern Cape, which is why it is not surprising that Durban has the lowest number of child marriages. The ukuthwala culture recognises that a women’s chores in marriage are to to cook and scrub and to produce children by the gross.

Chairperson of the University of South Africa's Unisa-Africa Girl Development Programme Professor Deirdre Byrne concurs that the custom of ukuthwala is part of the problem. Byrne says: “As long as ukuthwala is not culturally and socially condemned, you will find that young girls are taken by older men to be their sexual playthings and partners.

Children given away in child marriages normally abandon school, not because they hate school but because normally their marriage lives come in the way of their education. Child marriages also infringes on several other rights of children. Their right to childhood, safety, their right to health care, to education, their right to a safe home life, are all flushed out in child marriages.

The reality of child marriages is alarming in a country like South Africa which has one of the best Constitutions in the world.

Why is South Africa, with its Constitution, confronted with the reality of child marriages?        The reality in South Africa is that there is no prosecution of the type of violation of Section 2 of the Constitution that we are seeing in the case of child marriages. There are many provisions for the protection of the safety of children, but I do not think there is the political will to ensure that the noble ideals of the Bill of Rights are put into practice on the ground,” adds Byrne.

More stringent means to eradicate the inequality that prevails in South African society are also necessary in the battle against child marriages. According to Byrne, dealing with inequality requires a multi-faceted remedy. “We need a concerted and directed attack on poverty. We need a targeted job creation programme as well as much better education systems than those we currently have in place, and do away with government corruption entirely,” Byrne says.

Patriarchy reinforced by cultural believes and practices values the life of a son far higher than that of a daughter due to the status of a boy carrying the family name, continuing the family business, and contributing financially to the family home. Girls are in such an instance seen as a drain on the resources and with the father making all the decisions the girl’s prospects are grim.” Patriarchy reinforced by cultural believes and practices values the life of a son far higher than that of a daughter due to the status of a boy carrying the family name, continuing the family business, and contributing financially to the family home.

The programme is designed to identify, develop, and promote emerging young African female leaders on their path to greatness. In addition, it will engage with dynamic young women interested in developing transformational leadership skills, equipping them with knowledge in how to address issues facing women and children and the tools required to succeed in today’s world as a woman leader.

According to Professor Byrne, “one possible route would be to prosecute those who attempt to conduct or give permission for under-age marriages. This would send a strong message that this cannot be tolerated. However, we have to look at the root causes, of which poverty is the most powerful. The kind of parents prepared to give their children away are-in all likelihood only doing it for financial gain and desperation for financial resources”.
