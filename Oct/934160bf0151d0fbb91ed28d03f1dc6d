McKinsey wants us to believe the multinational with a R109-billion-a-year reputation was so inspired by their mission to drag Eskom into the light that it jumped in bed with a company everyone else by then thought was dodgy – without a contract and without the slightest idea of its ownership.

Together, they divvied up the spoils, including from the contentious nuclear build programme. Eskom steering committee minutes of the McKinsey project also note how the firm took ownership of developing skills at Trillian’s behest. One set of these minutes, dated 9 February 2016, even described Trillian as McKinsey’s BEE partner. Not one McKinsey official objected to this label at the time. All of this happened while McKinsey dithered on their due diligence on Trillian.

And he is not alone in this assertion. A peer review by Oliver Wyman Marsh at the behest of Eskom found the fees charged by McKinsey were exorbitant and most probably did not match the work the company, “alongside” Trillian, conducted.

Under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, McKinsey has a duty to ensure that its dealings do not result in or enable questionable money flows. If Corruption Watch has its way, McKinsey might have to answer these questions in court.
