Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s Medium Term Budget Policy Statement last week had one simple message: we are drowning in debt.        So it wasn’t surprising when he said the proposed nuclear build being pushed so vociferously by President Jacob Zuma was “unaffordable”. Gigaba said there was no room for nuclear in South Africa’s current budget, and that the nuclear plan would be reviewed once a new Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) provided further clarity.

Gigaba said there was no room for nuclear in South Africa’s current budget, and that the nuclear plan would be reviewed once a new Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) provided further clarity.        It was curious then to hear new Minister of Energy David Mahlobo, another staunch Zuma ally, saying afterwards that the numbers in the budget policy statement were “speculation” and that in fact there was finality regarding the nuclear build. What he was saying was that it would proceed.

This contradiction indicates clearly the incoherence that has become characteristic of the latter years of the Zuma administration. Zuma after all operates in the shadows. Sowing the seeds of doubt regarding the nuclear deal with Russia is intended to muddy the waters and avoid clarity and thus the inevitable push back from civil society.

The application, brought by civil society groups, meant that the so-called nuclear deal went back to the drawing board.

The court found that the South African-Russian nuclear co-operation deal was “unconstitutional and unlawful” given that there was no public participation in the process. The deal has been shrouded in secrecy from the start.

The nature of the international agreements also meant they had to be tabled in Parliament in terms of section 231 (2) of the constitution, the court held. This required the approval of both Houses of Parliament. However, Joemat-Pettersson deliberately tabled the international co-operation agreements between the United States, Russia and South Korea in terms of s231 (3), which doesn’t require parliamentary endorsement. That section states that agreements of a “technical, administrative or executive nature” needn’t have the approval of both Houses of Parliament and only need to be tabled “within a reasonable time”. That, the court held, was irrational and the ruling thwarted Zuma’s nuclear plans.

The National Development Plan (NDP) encourages a host of alternatives to nuclear and warns about affordability – yet the president appears hell-bent on nuclear power for reasons one can only speculate on. The plan has a clear commitment to an “energy mix” that would include renewable energy sources. The draft 2016 IRP should be the primary policy guide and describes a future energy mix that includes, but isn’t limited to, nuclear energy. Government seems to be relying on the 2010 IRP that suggests 9600MW nuclear power is needed.
