She continued: “During my constituency period, I received a number of complaints about illegal deductions. There was nothing we could do because we were told beneficiaries had to fill out a form themselves. You talk about Tweets and Facebook, but how do you communicate with senior citizens? This is problematic,” she said. ANC MP Hope Malgas said Sassa’s communication strategy to its beneficiaries “was just not working”.

Dunkerley said if beneficiaries are unable to fill out dispute resolution forms, they needed to complete an affidavit at their nearest police station and take it to a Sassa office. “We can then register the dispute and follow up to make sure that it is resolved. While investigating a number of disputes on deductions we have found that the beneficiary acknowledges taking the loan, but not in all cases. Where we find that no authority was given for the deduction, we then facilitate that a refund be made to the beneficiary,” she said.

We are still uncertain why there was this increase, but during the year under review we made use of the Integrated Community Registration Outreach Programme which was used to reach rural areas with mobile units. We believe this could also have contributed to the increase in applications,” she said. This spike in applications would not, however, impact its budget as there were also grants which left the system due to deaths or children turning 18,” she said.
