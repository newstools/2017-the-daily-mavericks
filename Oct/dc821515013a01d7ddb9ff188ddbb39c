       During a tour of South Africa’s Parliament, we got to hear a number of MPs from different parties speak; we were shown the Parliamentary library, and we were taken to the galleries of the National Assembly and the old Assembly Chamber, which were both in session. This comprehensive tour was both an informative and a positive experience at a time when the perception of South African politics feels incoherent and gloomy.

This comprehensive tour was both an informative and a positive experience at a time when the perception of South African politics feels incoherent and gloomy.         In the first part of the tour, MPs from the Democratic Alliance, the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, the United Democratic Movement and the Congress of the People spoke to our group. Each speaker represented their particular party and articulated their stance on a range of issues important to the students, such as democratic processes, student fees, corruption, education, inequality and unemployment – concerns that are shared by millions of young people around the country.

It might seem trivial, but if one steps back to consider the broader political landscape of dwindling support, along with corruption, factionalism, rising unemployment and increasing competition from opposition parties, the absence of the ANC from our tour of Parliament is telling of a party that’s slowly become out of touch with the aspirations and experiences of young people.

However, they’ve simultaneously seen a lack of access to opportunities, employment and proper education. With this in mind, they have the potential to dramatically affect the outcome of the 2019 national election – an outcome opposition MPs from the Economic Freedom Fighters and the Democratic Alliance in particular spoke about often during the first session of the tour.

Out of South Africa’s population of roughly 55-million, about 66% are 35 years old or younger.

According to  According to  According to  According to  According to  a 2016 report a 2016 report a 2016 report a 2016 report a 2016 report  from the Institute for Security Studies, lots of young people feel disconnected from the political arena. In dozens of interviews contained in the report, people again and again refer to socio-economic challenges like unemployment, poor infrastructure, poor education and corruption. Moreover, corruption greatly affects whether or not young people participate in democratic processes, which has contributed to low levels of trust between them and government.   from the Institute for Security Studies, lots of young people feel disconnected from the political arena.

Talking with students and fielding their questions is one way to improve trust. Unlike, perhaps, television or social media, platforms which provide exposure but little access, having the opportunity to hear politicians speak and field individual questions in a small and semi-formal environment is not a typical experience for students, or most people.

As a result, this kind of event has the potential to affect one’s perception, whether positively or negatively, of a party and of government. That the ANC failed to recognise this reality, in what was a relatively simple public relations exercise with university students, is a reflection of the broader ways in which they seem to be taking the votes of young South Africans for granted.

In the meantime, the political dynamics of the youth in South Africa are changing rapidly. They don’t comprise a monolith; they have varied experiences, expectations, goals and ideas; and they have different interpretations of the meaning of the past, and what direction the course of the future should take. Unlike their parents and older generations, young people don’t feel beholden to the ANC.  In the meantime, the political dynamics of the youth in South Africa are changing rapidly.

The youth of South Africa don’t have the time to be a patient supporter of the ANC. Similarly, the ANC is running out of time – or has no time remaining – to engage young people and position the party as a viable option for improving their lives.
