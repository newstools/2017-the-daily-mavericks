  1  1   1 What ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe said at a speech to the party faithful in Plettenberg Bay this week wasn’t new. The fact that he is better known for pushing a dry party line, and the fact that he’s a very powerful man in the ANC right now, made it newsworthy to such an extent that a number of Twitterati were again double-checking that his account had still not, in fact, been hacked.

Mantashe repeated what he had said in Limpopo about two weeks before, that it was tradition that the party’s deputy president (Cyril Ramaphosa) should be elected president. Should President Jacob Zuma mess with this formula, Mantashe hinted that this could lead to havoc, or at least a split in the party.

And although the words about the ANC’s traditions sound good and authoritative, it is by no means a foolproof argument. Nowhere in the ANC’s constitution is this prescribed.

In 2007 Mantashe and supporters of President Jacob Zuma used the same call when they wanted to get rid of the incumbent, and now, again, the call is convenient for keeping out Zuma’s preferred successor.

Mantashe, who has been secretary-general for a decade, has hopes of remaining in the ANC’s top six. Some even say he’s been wooed by both Dlamini Zuma and Ramaphosa’s slates.

A rumour has, of late, done the rounds that Mantashe was considering running as chairperson on Dlamini Zuma’s slate, so by making this pronouncement on Ramaphosa and tradition openly and often, he’s clearly nailing his colours to the mast.

A week ago Mantashe sent a memo to provincial secretaries, detailing the number of delegates each province is entitled to send to the December conference.

From that it was clear that even though Dlamini Zuma seems to be favoured by the numbers, both candidates would have to try to dip into the other’s support bases just to be sure.

Hence, Ramaphosa is going to KwaZulu-Natal – at the invitation of the Young Communist League – this weekend. His supporters claim it was long planned and could be his last visit before December, which perhaps indicates that he knows the support he could get from there is capped.

Nevertheless, the last time he addressed a KZN cadres’ forum in May, the provincial leadership told him he was ill-disciplined to do so uninvited. Now, with a court having ruled that the 2015 conference where this leadership was elected is void, Ramaphosa could get away with saying the provincial executive committee’s status is doubtful and their right to act against him limited.

Ramaphosa is set to go there in his official capacity to oversee progress on the government’s Expanded Public Works Programme – much in the same way, perhaps, that Jacob Zuma is going to Limpopo next week to attend the opening of a pedestrian bridge across the N1 between Polokwane and Makhado. There is to be a “community engagement” afterwards at the Naughty Boys Sports Ground in Botlokwa.

By the end of November, when the provinces go to their general councils and the sealed nominations from the branches are opened, it might be pretty clear in advance who will be the winner.

She's pretty much had her share of reporting on South African politics, attending gatherings and attracting trolls, but still finds herself attracted to it like a moth to a veld fire.  Her ultimate ambition in life is to become a travelling chocolate writer of international fame.   1  1   1
