A few years back, travelling around Madagascar, I came across a giant – albeit down-at-the-heels – sports stadium in the capital city, Antananarivo. Since this construction seemed more substantial than practically every other building in the city, and because it looked nothing at all like any still-remaining examples of colonial French-style architecture that were part of the city’s heritage, the origin of the massive stadium was a bit of a puzzle.

Ah, of course. Over the years, one of the hereditary communist hermit kingdom’s more unusual activities globally has been dispatching architects, construction and mechanical engineers, and construction battalions to erect a whole panoply of modernist monstrosities, all built in a particular brutalist style, often in unlikely spots. In addition to the buildings themselves, there has also been a steady stream of those Stalinist-style-more-than-life-size heroic public art statues of presidents, freedom fighters, glorious revolutions and the like.

Pre-eminent in this construction work has been a North Korean company named Mansu Dae, with its two public art and construction wings. Mansu Dae was established nearly half a century ago, and it has become North Korea’s most visible art studio – now with business connections throughout Africa and on into Southeast Asia. It has been estimated by people who do such things that six years ago it earned around $160-million from its various overseas building monuments and memorials. In its projects it operates as a closely held company, using only North Koreans as artists, engineers, and general construction workers, rather than employing any local people for these tasks.

About 15 years ago, Namibia began issuing major construction projects to Mansu Dae. And now, there are reports that Mansu Dae both built and operated a munitions factory there. This, not surprisingly, has been described as a significant violation of UN-voted sanctions directed against North Korea by the UN staffers assigned to monitor such efforts.

Of course, this kind of eliding around the rules behaviour may also parallel reported carryings on of North Korean diplomats. For years, it was common knowledge – according to the diplomatic rumour mill – that the North Koreans financed much of the overhead costs of their embassies through some really good quality, painstaking counterfeit US dollars. There have also been allegations that drug smuggling was part of their oeuvre as well.

Further, Nandi-Ndaitwah said the UN sanctions are primarily aimed at North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme and do not prohibit Namibia from having diplomatic or other military relations with Pyongyang. She said the small arms and ammunition factory built by North Korea cannot be seen as a contravention of UN sanctions because all the products it manufactures are not for export but for use by Namibian security agencies. Further, Nandi-Ndaitwah said the UN sanctions are primarily aimed at North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme and do not prohibit Namibia from having diplomatic or other military relations with Pyongyang.        “However, Namibia’s assessment varies with the leaked UN report, which concluded that ‘the construction of any munitions factory or related military facilities is considered to be services or assistance relating to the provision, manufacture or maintenance of arms and related material and therefore, prohibited under the resolutions.’ ” “However, Namibia’s assessment varies with the leaked UN report, which concluded that ‘the construction of any munitions factory or related military facilities is considered to be services or assistance relating to the provision, manufacture or maintenance of arms and related material and therefore, prohibited under the resolutions.’ ” However, Namibia’s assessment varies with the leaked UN report, which concluded that ‘the construction of any munitions factory or related military facilities is considered to be services or assistance relating to the provision, manufacture or maintenance of arms and related material and therefore, prohibited under the resolutions.’ ” However, Namibia’s assessment varies with the leaked UN report, which concluded that ‘the construction of any munitions factory or related military facilities is considered to be services or assistance relating to the provision, manufacture or maintenance of arms and related material and therefore, prohibited under the resolutions.’ ” However, Namibia’s assessment varies with the leaked UN report, which concluded that ‘the construction of any munitions factory or related military facilities is considered to be services or assistance relating to the provision, manufacture or maintenance of arms and related material and therefore, prohibited under the resolutions.’ ”        In fact, in a number of African nations, governments have been doing deals with North Korea for years, and some of these may be for more than building ostentatious, splashy buildings or more of those appalling statues. There is, obviously, a geo-political element to this. With North Korea’s continuing efforts to develop a nuclear weapon that can be fitted onto a intercontinental ballistic missile, CNN had reported, “United States and United Nations investigators are looking a lot more closely at Pyongyang’s African connection. The UN says many of the contracts are with Mansu Dae, a North Korean state-owned enterprise and a cash cow for the rogue regime.” In fact, in a number of African nations, governments have been doing deals with North Korea for years, and some of these may be for more than building ostentatious, splashy buildings or more of those appalling statues.

CNN’s correspondent, visiting the Mansu Dae compound outside Windhoek, had found that the North Korean enterprise had purchased the site and had been carrying on rather heavy-duty work there until just a few weeks ago, with a large contingent of North Koreans living there – and even raising food in gardens inside the compound.

The Namibian government admits they had contracts with the company, but they have insisted nothing was amiss. Deputy Prime Minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah told CNN, “All of these were agreed before the sanctions by the UN.

It is not enough to say you have been exonerated by the UN for North Korean sanctions violations because that is not true. The panel deals with hard facts – with evidence – and this is what we have been asking for many months now,” said Hugh Griffiths, the co-ordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, the body charged with monitoring sanctions enforcement on the country.

CNN’s correspondent went on to explain, per the UN panel, that Namibia had contracted North Korean workers and state companies to construct a munitions factory. While the Namibian government told Griffiths’ predecessor they were fully compliant with applicable UN sanctions, “In fact, at the time there was a large group of Korean workers building a munitions factory in direct violation of the resolutions. So they were being untruthful,” Giffiths noted. While the Namibian government said that work had ceased last year, local observers told CNN that didn’t appear to be the case. In fact, Namibia is not alone in having found a way to a defence relationship to the isolated Asian nation in the recent past; even nations like Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda now insist that they are in compliance with UN rules.

Heretofore, it has been rather rare for the US and Namibia to find much to quarrel about.
