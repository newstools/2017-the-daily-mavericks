       If there is one thing that President Jacob Zuma has shown he is a master at, it is the art of the long game, the placing of pieces in particular positions for use when necessary. He is also excellent at the short game, his apparent manipulation of the process that saw the IFP nominating Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to the position of public protector – and her actions in making decisions that seem to weaken his opponents is testament to that. When Mkhize first became seen as a real candidate in this race, there was immediate whispering that Zuma was behind this all along. But that whisper has since started to grow louder. On Monday UDM leader Bantu Holomisa made the claim in public, and the always prescient and observant Professor Anthony Butler has also suggested that this has been the plan all along.

He may feel that he is running on his own two feet, and that to be tied to Zuma in any way is potentially damaging for his campaign. He has in large measure succeeded in giving an impression of being a “Mr Clean”. In fact, should he win the ANC leadership in December, the reaction of the markets is likely to be almost as positive as if Ramaphosa were to emerge victorious. Some analysts watching all of this from foreign capitals even appear to believe that Mkhize would be more able to carry through reforms to the economy than Ramaphosa. This may be because he would appear to have broader support, but also because of his role in pushing Zuma to remove Des van Rooyen as Finance Minister during those dark days of December 2015 and appoint Pravin Gordhan to the position instead.

What happened then was surely Mkhize pushing hard against Zuma. While he may have been speaking for the upper leadership of the ANC (which is hard to know, Jessie Duarte certainly didn’t seem to have a problem with changes to the Treasury), he would surely have had to twist Zuma’s arm hard to rescind Van Rooyen’s appointment. And we do know that Zuma really wanted to make that move permanent, based on the number of visits Van Rooyen paid to the Guptas’ Saxonwold fortress.

In a recent statement reacting to a claim about the events in 2006, Mkhize said this, “Inasmuch as I personally still had fundamental difficulty with what appeared to be relationship between the President and Fezeka, given our history as three families, I had to respect the fact that Fezeka was now an adult who was entitled to make her own life choices.” That surely suggests he was condemnatory of Zuma’s actions in this incident.

Even if Mkhize has the backing of Zuma in this, and some deal were struck (and it’s hard to imagine an explicit deal was agreed to as long as five years ago), there are plenty of examples of people turning on their former champions when they gain real political power. There is no reason to think that Mkhize would not turn on Zuma, or at least just ignore him, were he to ascend to the Union Buildings.

Especially when she may well have been able to get a second term as Chair of the African Union Commission. That’s quite a sacrifice to make. It would surely indicate that Zuma has been desperate, and aware that there was no way he could actually prevail in any other way. It would suggest that he knows he is deeply unpopular in many parts of the party, and the country, and thus has to play an incredibly dirty game just to have any chance. Zuma has not indicated this level of self-knowledge in the past. It may be a mistake to assume that he “gets” how he is viewed now.

That he is going to great lengths to keep the man he made Deputy President out of the top job. The question then would be why? Are things so bad between them that Zuma believes Ramaphosa would immediately move to reinstate the corruption charges against him? Could it be a straight patronage fight where he wants to protect the ill-gotten gains of his family (and another…)?

He clearly would not care what happens to the country from a policy point of view. In other words, there would be no ideological direction that he would want South Africa to continue to move in.

Many people have been at a loss to explain his sudden move to push for a unity candidate at this late stage, particularly when Mabuza has always appeared to back Zuma, and their interests still appear to be aligned. Considering that Mkhize is the person to gain from this move, Mabuza’s move could be offered as the explanation.

That would surely give the game away, people would know that this would be to the benefit of Mkhize (unless of course Ramaphosa were to withdraw at the same time, as part of a deal between them all). And that would be interpreted as Zuma trying to still control the ANC from the political grave.

It would be a contest of a “constitutionalist reformer” and an “economic reformer”. Ideologically, this would be a much tighter race than Ramaphosa/Dlamini Zuma. Neither of the main candidates would spend their time talking about “Radical Economic Transformation” or land expropriation without compensation. Mzwanele Manyi would be a loser long before the first ballot was cast. This would surely mean that chances of ANC policy remaining as they are would be much greater. Paradoxically, it could also mean economic policy changing for the better after December, in that whoever won could claim to have a mandate to use more orthodox policy to make the economy great again. With an election due in 2019 and unemployment rising, this would be the best way to win that poll. That then leads to what a straight race between Mkhize and Ramaphosa would look like.
