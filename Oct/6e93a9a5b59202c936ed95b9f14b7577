Anyone who doesn’t comply will be in violation of national laws and the amnesty, and will be arrested and prosecuted according to the laws of the relevant member state.

Anyone who doesn’t comply will be in violation of national laws and the amnesty, and will be arrested and prosecuted according to the laws of the relevant member state.        The initiative is carried out in line with African and international best practices, which identify states as the recipients of the surrendered arms. Member states are required to develop and implement (where absent) national legislation and programmes for the voluntary surrender of illegal small arms and light weapons.

A number of arms control instruments provide a basis for such peaceful disarmament practices. These include the 2000 Bamako Declaration on an African Common Position on the Illicit Proliferation, Circulation and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons, and the 2001 United Nations (UN) Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.

At the open session to inaugurate Africa Amnesty Month, the AU PSC urged member states to collect and destroy all excess and obsolete small arms and light weapons. It also encouraged them to ensure effective management and protection of their weapons depots and stockpiles, and to ensure that the weapons aren’t diverted to illicit markets – an easy source of arms used by non-state actors such as terrorists and rebels.

There are therefore already important landmarks in international regulatory frameworks for the weapons trade which, if strictly observed, will contribute to the success of Africa Amnesty Month.

However, many AU member states are yet to sign and ratify the ATT. A number of countries are also still to ratify and/or adopt sub-regional arms control legal instruments.         These instruments must work together for the amnesty to work. Therefore the AU and its Regional Economic Communities and Regional Mechanisms must ensure that member states adopt and domesticate international instruments such as the ATT, the International Tracing Instrument and relevant sub-regional arms control protocols and conventions. Member states should also adhere to relevant decisions on cross-border management and maritime security, among others. These instruments must work together for the amnesty to work.

Member states should also adhere to relevant decisions on cross-border management and maritime security, among others.        The AU must also encourage African states to implement and enforce UN arms embargoes. There have been a number of UN arms embargoes in conflict-affected areas such as Somalia, the Central African Republic, Eritrea, Libya, Darfur (in Sudan) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, not enough attention has been paid to the implementation of these embargoes on a continent level. The AU must also encourage African states to implement and enforce UN arms embargoes.

The AU should develop an internal capacity to engage in sustained data gathering and information sharing, aimed at tackling emerging evidence such as that from the UN Panel of Experts. Equal attention should be given to the flow of ammunition in and out of conflict zones. The AU could also establish commissions of inquiry for targeted investigations as the need arises, in close cooperation with the UN sanctions committees.

They will however need to be accompanied by actions to address the drivers of conflict in Africa, such as poor governance, inequality, marginalisation and political oppression.
