       It is now approaching 100 days since Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Browne appointed new Eskom Group Interim CEO Johnny Dladla to replace suspended former interim CEO Matshela Koko, who in turn was appointed to replace disgraced previous CEO Brian Molefe.

Since then, the industry and the country has been waiting with bated breath for Mr Dladla to show his hand and reveal his own personality, leadership character and goals.         Is he a genuine leader with a longer-term vision and mission for the troubled electricity utility? Or is he just in a temporary, bureaucratic holding position, pending the appointment of the next Eskom executive leader and board by the minister?

Or is he just in a temporary, bureaucratic holding position, pending the appointment of the next Eskom executive leader and board by the minister?         One presumes that the recruitment process – started in early 2017 by the Eskom board after the emotional resignation/early retirement/unpaid leave/ retrenchment/departure of Molefe following his exposure in the Public Protector’s State of Capture report – is still in progress.

Although Dladla had reportedly not applied for the advertised Eskom Group CEO position prior to his appointment as interim CEO, one has to wonder whether he has since applied (or may still apply) for the position. To this question, Dladla remains mum, saying only that the position of Eskom group CEO is “as uncertain as the national lottery”.

One has to also wonder as to the integrity and motives of both the DPE minister and the depleted Eskom board in appointing Koko as acting Eskom Group CEO in the first place to replace Molefe, while there were so many obvious and publicly visible lies, unanswered questions and other clouds hanging over his head.

Eskom’s qualified audit revealed some R3-billion of irregular expenditure, and precipitated threats by the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) to call in a R15-billion loan unless the man viewed by many as the corrupt power behind the scenes – chief financial officer and board member Anoj Singh – was removed. This culminated shortly thereafter in Singh being placed on special leave.

This culminated shortly thereafter in Singh being placed on special leave.   4  4   4 Since Dladla’s appointment, Eskom has been forced to back-track and admit irregular payments of some R1.6-billion to management consultants McKinsey and Trillian Capital Partners, without any contract. This has resulted in the suspension of Singh and other senior Eskom executives on 28 September 2017, and the commencement of disciplinary processes against them.

One may have thought this would be sufficient to invoke summary dismissal of the offenders. Indeed the prima facie evidence of the “capture” of Eskom by the Guptas was enough for Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises to announce a full-scale parliamentary inquiry into Eskom with great fanfare on 11 June 2017.

Outstanding municipal debt to Eskom is also rising fast. Credit rating agencies have downgraded Eskom to below investment grade, and roll-over and extending Eskom debt will come at significantly increased cost.

In fact, a recent statement by Goldman Sachs, raised questions as to whether Eskom’s precarious financial position is in fact a serious threat and a danger to South Africa.
