They were more concerned to know why there was no sign yet of the NDP’s proposed National Policing Board or any of the other priorities listed in the NDP to modernise and transform the police services.        The hearing comes at a time that Parliament is marking the fifth anniversary of the launch of the NDP. Most members of the Portfolio Committee didn’t seem to think there was much sign of the professional, skilled and community-based police service envisaged in the NDP. If anything they expressed dismay at the SAPS’s evident lack of progress in making South Africa a safer place.

If anything they expressed dismay at the SAPS’s evident lack of progress in making South Africa a safer place.         On the demilitarisation of the SAPS, one of the NDP’s priorities for a police service that protects the community against crime and violence, there was considerable confusion. The SAPS and some committee members said they were unsure about what exactly was meant by demilitarisation. It also begs the question, can it be applied in a country that clearly needs its public order policing and tactical response teams?

It also begs the question, can it be applied in a country that clearly needs its public order policing and tactical response teams?         The SAPS announced that it was currently researching the matter, which prompted a piqued comment from the Civilian Secretariat for Police Service which, it turns out, is also doing the same research and had conducted a study in 2016/17 which concluded that “specialised units” can be paramilitary in nature “as they rely on rank structure for command and control, their members wear the same uniform [and] they have access to substantial weaponry”. In other words, the Civilian Secretariat for Police Service was left asking “if they are militarised or not, and if so, to what extent”.

Even the ever-polite chairperson Beukman showed signs of impatience, especially during the presentation by the SAPS of its well over 100-page report, much of which the committee had heard before and had little to do with the application of the NDP.

Another ongoing discussion is around the NDP’s call for a multidisciplinary national policing board, which would help with recruiting and selecting police officers and monitoring ethics and standards of professionalism in the force.  Another ongoing discussion is around the NDP’s call for a multidisciplinary national policing board, which would help with recruiting and selecting police officers and monitoring ethics and standards of professionalism in the force.         Five years on, deliberations now centre on whether a stand-alone board or a board within the Civilian Secretariat for Police Service would be most desirable. The only agreement so far is that legislative amendments would be required in either case, which would be a protracted and complex process.

The committee heard that persistent failures in police leadership at the very highest levels were the ongoing cause of the systemic crises within the SAPS. Gareth Newham, Head of the ISS Justice and Violence Prevention Programme, pointed out that there are any number of highly skilled, professional career policewomen or men, committed to protecting communities against violence, who could be excellent candidates for the position of Police Commissioner.

Instead, in the last eight years there has been a turnover of five appointees in this post, “and we know what has become of most of them”. Astonishingly, the only requirements for the job at the very top of the SAPS is to be over 18, a South African citizen and not have a criminal record. The criteria needed to become a constable are more stringent than those required to be SAPS National Commissioner.

Newham put forward the view that leaving this critical appointment to be made by the President alone could lead to questionable decision-making. The same is true, he said, of the pending selection of a new head of the Hawks.

This echoes one of the proposals spelled out in the NDP: “The National Commissioner of Police and deputies should be appointed by the President on a competitive basis.” The NDP goes on to declare that the President should make his selection based on reports and recommendations made by a professional panel, which would “select and interview candidates for these posts against objective criteria” and submit nominations to the President. He would make his decision based on the proposals of the panel.

For too long the individuals appointed to the post of National Commissioner, and more recently the head of the Hawks, have tended to lack the necessary expertise, experience and integrity to effectively carry out the requirements of these crucial posts,” ISS and Corruption Watch said in a joint statement.

The National Development Plan has identified this shortcoming as causing a ‘serial crisis of top management in the police’ that is having a negative impact on the organisation. The consequences of poor management are increasingly becoming clearer.” The National Development Plan has identified this shortcoming as causing a ‘serial crisis of top management in the police’ that is having a negative impact on the organisation.

During this period, police detection rates dropped significantly as did the percentage of arrests and convictions by the Hawks.

At the same time the SAPS annual budget has seen a 50% increase since 2011 to an all-time high in the current financial year, “and it’s not going to get much bigger, there are not going to be more resources”, Newham told the committee. What is needed is effective and efficient policing, he said.
