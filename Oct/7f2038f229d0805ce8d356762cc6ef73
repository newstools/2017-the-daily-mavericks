       We find ourselves here today due to decisions and actions that were taken by the Gauteng Department of Health in 2015. Those decisions and actions related to the termination of the contract by the department with Life Esidimeni (LE). LE is a private facility that, for more than 30 years, had been providing health services on behalf of the state to mental health users who required long-term and specialised psychiatric care. The department decided to transfer the patients from LE to 27 NGOs around Gauteng. This decision and the manner in which it was executed resulted in the death of at least 94 mental health patients according to the Health Ombud, Prof Makgoba.

Either this simple act of data gathering has eluded the department, or the families, and this process, have not been taken seriously. Despite repeated requests, as we have already pointed out, the department has not been able to provide a complete and credible list.

On 21 October 2015, the Gauteng Department of Health announced that it would terminate its contract with Life Esidimeni. So disquieting was this announcement that it prompted the heads of each psychiatric hospital unit in Gauteng to detail what they describe as “grave concerns” in writing to the provincial department on 28 April 2015. In June 2015, the SA Society of Psychiatrists also wrote to the department setting out their concerns regarding the risks posed by the intended transfer of MHCUs.

Most discovered their loved ones had been moved after the fact. Many were not contacted at all and, once they discovered their family member had been moved through one means or another, were left to scramble to find the new location of the family member. This often took days and even weeks. The majority of families represented in these proceedings were not contacted prior to the move of their loved ones.

Dr Selebano responded saying that “I am sure the colleagues who have been copied will engage with the contents of your email. Mr Mosenogi will provide me with a status report and you may also talk to him directly. This is a painful chapter for all of us.” Apart from this, SADAG received no further response to this letter.

Mental healthcare users were loaded onto buses and bakkies and distributed – or in the language used by the department, “decanted” – to various facilities across the province. The MEC reported on a number of occasions that users did not have their belongings or even a change of clothes with them. She also reported that many mental healthcare users left Life Esidimeni without their IDs or medical records. We know that many of the NGOs did not have contact details for family members.

The department cited two justifications for the project: resource constraints and the requirement to de-institutionalise.   1  1   1 We know from the Ombud’s report that the move of users out of Life Esidimeni led to a significant number of admissions to mental health hospitals including Sterkfontein, Weskoppies and Cullinan Care and Rehabilitation Centre (“CCRC”), at great expense. While at Life Esidimeni, the department paid R320 per person per day, at Weskoppies it would have to pay R1,960 per person per day; at Sterkfontein it would pay R1,386 per person per day; and at CCRC it would pay R1,486 per person per day. The department paid NGOs on average R112 per person per day.

It requires significant investment in the communities and NGOs that are meant to care for the MHCUs.

The resource constraints justification for the move of users out of Life Esidimeni does not, therefore, explain the move.   1  1   1 The department also said that the termination of the Life Esidimeni contract was in line with the National Mental Health Policy Framework and Strategic Plan 2013-2020, which provides for the de-institutionalisation of mental health users. While the Policy Framework does provide for de-institutionalisation, it also recognises that: “de-institutionalisation has progressed at a rapid rate in South Africa, without the necessary development of community-based services. This has led to a high number of homeless mentally ill, people living with mental illness in prisons and revolving patterns of care”.

This resulted in fear, confusion, trauma and a sense of “homelessness” by the mental healthcare users.

SASOP wrote to the department no less than five times between March 2015 and October 2015. Ultimately, they, together with SADAG, the SA Federation for Mental health and the Association of Concerned Family Members of Residents of Life Esidimeni, brought an urgent court application to interdict the transfer of patients until a proper plan was in place, and for the appointment of a curator ad litem to protect the rights of the patients. The matter was settled out of court the day before the hearing was to take place. The agreement reflected the undertaking by the department to engage in a meaningful consultation process with the patients and their families in order to ensure a safe and orderly transfer that would not jeopardise the rights of the patients. As we now know, the department reneged on that agreement.

What was the motivation that drove this course of action? The burden of answering this lies with the government.
