Thousands of foster care placement orders will expire by 31 December which means the accompanying foster care grant may not be paid out. DA MP Karen Jooste said social workers can, through the court, get placement orders to place neglected or abused children with foster care parents who will then receive the grant of R920 per month. This is a temporary arrangement and the placement order must be reviewed every two years.

She also asked what the total value is of the foster care grants for placements that will no longer be paid because of the care orders lapsing. She also wanted to know if the department had taken any steps to prevent the “crisis”.

The Department of Social Development found itself in court when the Child Law Centre challenged the minister over the high amount of foster care grants lapsing due to backlogs. The North Gauteng High Court in its ruling acknowledged the need for “comprehensive legal reform”. The court then set a moratorium on grants lapsing until December 2014 and this deadline was later extended to December 2017. But rewind to 2011.

This includes putting in place “administrative mechanisms to manage the extension of foster care orders” and “allocation of social workers to conduct investigations, compile reports with recommendations for extension of foster care orders”. The measures Dlamini referred to are mainly aimed at addressing the backlogs and managing and processing extensions before 1 November 2017.
