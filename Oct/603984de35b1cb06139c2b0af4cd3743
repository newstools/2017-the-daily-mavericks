       On Friday morning the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein dismissed Zuma’s and the National Prosecuting Authority’s appeal in what became known as the “spy tapes” case.         Last year the High Court in Pretoria found that the NPA should not have withdrawn the 783 counts based on the spy tapes’ revelation that then head of the Scorpions, Leonard McCarthy and then head of the NPA, Bulelani Ngcuka schemed about the timing of indicting Zuma.        On Friday, Judge Eric Leach read an excerpt of the SCA judgment, written by Judge Mahomed Navsa.        The court was again strident in its criticism of the NPA, saying the timing of the indictment was irrelevant to the merits of the case against Zuma. The full judgment is yet to be released.        The ANC said it would study the judgment and await further decisions from the affected parties before making a comprehensive statement on this matter.  DM  DM        This story will be updated as soon as the SCA's  full judgment is available.
