A guard shrugged when asked when the university’s Student Centre might reopen. “We’re waiting for feedback,” he said. On the glass doors of administrative buildings, various legal notices were affixed. One was an old interdict barring four protesters – Ayakha Magxothwa, Sivuyise Nolusu, Leo Mongale and Lukhanyo Vangqa – from entering the premises. The “CPUT 4”, as they have become known, have attained martyr status in some quarters.

Piles of burnt rubble were strewn around the entrance to the campus Engineering faculty: a relic of the previous day’s activity. A small group of protesting students marched through it on Tuesday. “I would rather die standing up than live life on my knees,” one placard read. “#FeesMustFall! #CPUT4 is back!” read others.

The previous day, stun grenades and pepper spray had been used to disperse students who threw mattresses, bedding and bookshelves from the balcony of a university residence.

University offices on Roeland Street were reportedly broken into on Monday night, with doors kicked down by intruders described as “very young”, in search of expensive electronic equipment. This is not the most extreme act of destruction thus far: last month the famous St Mark’s Anglican Church of District Six, adjacent to CPUT, was petrol bombed. A university workshop was also destroyed, with some students allegedly losing their whole year’s portfolio of art and design work.

The four students were suspended at the end of August after forcing their way into a university council meeting and threatening to burn buildings. Described by the staff member as “highly influential”, the #CPUT4 were readmitted to the university this week subject to a 12-month suspended expulsion. In other words, if they are found guilty of disrupting activities within the next year, they may be expelled. Central to the mobilisation of the student protesters have been the so-called #CPUT4.

As has been the case since the outset of the national protests in 2015, workers’ rights are also on the agenda. Ironically, the securing of staff insourcing – one of the successes of past protests – has now become a bone of contention.

Part of the issue is that management didn’t explain to staff workers what the effects [of insourcing] would be,” explains the staff member. Workers apparently did not realise that their take-home salaries would drop when their status changed from outsourced workers to insourced, supplemented by benefits which are seen as intangible and irrelevant.

There’s a whole lot of stuff happening at CPUT that has nothing to do with fees,” says the staff member. “It feels like a township university. The aircon doesn’t work, to give one example. The lights could literally fall on you while you’re lecturing.
