SAPO CEO, Mark Barnes, is due to report back to the joint sitting on the apparent stand-off between Sassa and SAPO with regard to taking over the payment of social grants when the extended CPS contract expires in March 2018.

The usually even-tempered Scopa Chair, Themba Godi, after Dlamini’s failure to attend last week’s joint sitting, said he would write to Speaker Baleka Mbete to call for a debate and a vote of no confidence in Dlamini should she fail to appear on Tuesday. Dlamini has habitually opted to skip meetings aimed at accounting to Scopa and Parliament on this crucial matter.

These are card production facilities and the provision of banking and cash payment services.

Last week Scopa committee members accused Sassa officials of lying to the committee about the agency’s state of readiness with regard to timelines as well as providing crucial documents to a ConCourt-appointed panel of experts mandated to oversee the process. They also questioned the extremely short time period for any bidders to lodge “proof of concept” documents, a strategy which flags potential corruption and that a behind-the-scenes decision or deal has already been made and that the opening of a tender process may be merely a box-ticking excursion.

She also said Post Bank currently did not have a fully-fledged banking licence.

This proposal included an incentive for commercial banks to expand to remote rural areas where grants are paid out in cash.

So far it appears that Dlamini and the Sassa executive have done everything to prevent or delay this.

This will result in SAPO’s ability to open more accounts, and increase its capacity to eventually become a state bank.

In March this year the ConCourt handed down a scathing judgment of Dlamini and Sassa’s role in a self-inflicted crisis with regard to the expiry of the already extended irregular CPS contract. The court also appointed a panel of experts to oversee the transition of Sassa as paymaster, a process that was aimed at transparency.

The panel of experts also expressed alarm at the situation and that it posed a “serious risk” to the successful transition of the grant payment system.

It kicks off at 09:00. Should Dlamini fail to appear there is no doubt that Scopa is ready to subpoena her to do so. This differs from a usual presentation to Scopa where officials are not under oath. Being subpoenaed to appear brings with it legal consequences.
