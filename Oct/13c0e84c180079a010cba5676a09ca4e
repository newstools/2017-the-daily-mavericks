While having some prominent heads on the chopping block may satisfy some aspect of justice and our taste for revenge, it is unlikely to offer a thorough clearing out of corruption, a re-building of national trust and a healing of the ghosts of our past. Many of those ghosts, of the ANC in exile and the apartheid past, still haunt us and have undoubtedly contributed to where we are now. I say that not to exonerate anyone but to better understand the contaminated soil in which our new democracy was planted and the bitter fruits it would almost inevitably yield.

At a purely practical level, we need to avoid having endless trials clogging up the justice system; where would you find the evidence (we have some but there is certainly much more that would emerge if people felt freer and safer to talk), and who would you charge – the briber or the bribee, the giver of jobs or the one who accepted, the person who stole the money or the one who “held the ladder for the thief to climb in” as the Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town so poetically put it, the person who simply looked the other way when someone put false names on the list of pension pay-outs, the president of the country? (The latter would be good but that is unlikely while the current balance of power holds). The complicity is so wide that if the job is to be done properly, whole sections of the country will be engaged in endless prosecutions – unless amnesty is offered in return for truth and reparation. 3.

It must, of course be acknowledged that the current circumstances are not exactly what they were then. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission took place after apartheid was broken and a significant shift in political power had taken place. A comparable shift would be needed now for a new Truth and Restitution Commission to be viable. Whether that shift takes place within or without the ANC remains to be seen.

As to reparation, this was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s weakest area. It must be very strong in the case of the Truth and Restitution Commission. Under the circumstances the cry “pay back the money” is unlikely to go away and is indeed a very necessary aspect of the process. In some cases, money will not be returnable and then some other form of reparation should be required. Imaginative ways could be found. In all cases there should be consequences… but consequences short of prosecution for those who meet the TRC criteria of full disclosure and remorse. It should be clear too that all who appear are on “parole”. Any future corruption would be prosecuted with the full force of the law.

What such a process would enable would be a much more widespread discussion of values, actions and consequences, involving many South Africans who wish to come forward and say how they were harmed by corruption and State Capture.
