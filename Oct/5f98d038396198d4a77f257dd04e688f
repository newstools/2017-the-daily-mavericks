       Given the figures on sexual offences, hijackings and murder released by the Statistician-General, as a seasoned international traveller I would immediately reconsider and postpone my trip to South Africa, even if it is among the top 10 most beautiful destinations in the world (according to my own view after seeing most of them, SA is still number 1).

Since this news broke on 28 September I experienced the same views of many fellow South Africans who just don’t know what to believe any more and who are so disillusioned with everything that has occurred over the last five years that they prefer to tune in to their favourite soap opera or music.

There is a “So what? What can we do?” attitude that is shocking. It is strange that Statistician-General Pali Lehohla can be surprised that although crime in general, according to Statistics SA and the SAPS, decreased, feelings of insecurity increase, if he himself releases the kind of increases in the title of this article. Especially if all of Statistics SA’s victim surveys done during his tenure as the Statistician-General indicate that South Africans indeed have the capacity to distinguish between different kinds of crime and have different levels of fear of each.

The shocking events in Nyanga and Marikana in Philippi East, days before and after the Statistician-General’s release, may even generate such high levels of fear that it can trigger a revenge, counter-revenge, vigilante frenzy (and Minister Fikile Mbalula may run out of task teams).

The Statistician-General, National Commissioner (or mostly acting national commissioners), and Minister of Police should now stop underestimating the capacity and logic of South Africans to understand the crime situation. As was provided under an ANC government from 2002 to 2012, they should provide the leadership and support to lead South Africans out of this crime and fear mess. They should also stop confusing the public in their effort to say things are not so bad. The release of the latest (2016/2017) Victims of Crime Survey is an excellent example of this.

The 2016/2017 Statistics SA Victims of Crime Survey was released in the same week that the SAPS crime statistics are usually released. Unfortunately or fortunately, the SAPS crime statistics were for the first time in 15 years not released before the end of September, usually in the last week of September. But also this time the bulk of the Victims of Crime Survey report reads like a crime statistics report and not like a victim survey report. The bulk of it consist of figures of crime and comparisons over the past four financial years as if it is the recorded crime statistics. A victims of crime survey’s primary function is to establish the reporting and under-reporting (the so-called dark figure) of crime and the reasons for under-reporting. The police registration figures of crime are the crimes reported to them and which they can analyse and use as a basis for policing (it is literally the crime that lands on their table and which they and their partners should deal with – as an old police colleague put it to this author years ago: “The police can only deal with crime that they know of!” The author reacted with “… but we should also know the extent of the crime that we don’t know of and if the police can do anything to know of more crime they should do so.”)  The 2016/2017 Statistics SA Victims of Crime Survey was released in the same week that the SAPS crime statistics are usually released.

There are even larger differences up to 85.0% (for home robbery) between the Statistics SA figures in column 1 and the SAPS crime figures in column 2.  From this table it is clear that there are large differences of up to 73.7% (for home robbery) between the crime figures calculated by Statistics SA for 2016/2017 based on the 2016/2017 victim survey (column 1) and the adapted crime figures in column 3. There are even larger differences up to 85.0% (for home robbery) between the Statistics SA figures in column 1 and the SAPS crime figures in column 2.         There can be no doubt that these different figures for the same crime trends can produce diametrically opposing crime trends – where one analyst finds that a certain crime trend is increasing and another will find that the same trend is decreasing, depending on the data they use. Knowing the SAPS first trimester of 2016/2017 crime statistics, and out of experience the fact that the last quarter could not dramatically change from the first three quarters, I would predict a marginal increase of 1 to 2 percent in murder, a slight decrease in sexual offences of 2-3% and a plus-minus 15% increase in hijacking, which look very different from the increases of respectively 9%, 117% and 93% in murder, sexual offences and hijacking of the Statistician–General.

SAPS must release their crime statistics for 2016/2017 as a matter of urgency. The two departments then owe it to South Africa and its people, who carry the scars of crime and pay taxes for the crime surveys and the registration of crime, to meet and sort out the confusion and differences between the different sets of data. They should then explain to everybody how their data should be used. DM SAPS must release their crime statistics for 2016/2017 as a matter of urgency.
