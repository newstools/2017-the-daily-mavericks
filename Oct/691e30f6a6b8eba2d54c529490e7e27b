Over a year since the first reports emerged of psychiatric patients dying after being moved from Life Esidimeni to NGOs across Gauteng, on Monday a mediation process meant to resolve compensation and promote trust and healing will begin in Johannesburg.        Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba recommended the alternative dispute resolution process in his report, released in February, on the disaster that claimed at least 100 lives. Malegapuru said mediation could avoid protracted, divisive legal disputes and build trust between patients’ relatives and government officials. It will also determine how much compensation is to be paid to relatives.

You know when you are so bogged down in fighting, by the time you lift your head… it’s surreal,” said Nxumalo. For relatives, the alternative dispute resolution process, which will sit for three weeks and be led by retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, comes almost two years after they challenged the department’s plan to move patients out of Life Esidimeni. They have since fought to protect those who survived and hold officials accountable. I can’t believe we’re here.

In his report, the ombudsman said the provincial health department ignored warnings and moved patients out of Life Esidimeni and into ill-equipped and unlicensed NGOs. They were moved like cattle and over 100 left to die in poor conditions.

Nxumalo said compensation was a broad demand, but they would not name a figure. “There’s no point in putting through an amount, rather let government make an offer.” Although Premier David Makhura and Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi have accepted the state’s liability for the suffering and deaths, compensation is likely to be low as relatives were not financially reliant on the patients.

The mediation can subpoena witnesses and the families have made a list of those they want questioned, including department officials, such as former health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, and those who ran NGOs where patients died. They also want more information on how their loved ones died, counselling, a monument to be erected, and a sincere apology from the state.
