They were rounded up from their homes and brought to the venue in private cars, including a very old woman who walked at snail’s pace with a Zimmer Frame. Another woman loudly scolded the man who brought her there. Her cries about “politicking” bordered on hysteria.

She's pretty much had her share of reporting on South African politics, attending gatherings and attracting trolls, but still finds herself attracted to it like a moth to a veld fire.  Her ultimate ambition in life is to become a travelling chocolate writer of international fame.                 1  1   1
