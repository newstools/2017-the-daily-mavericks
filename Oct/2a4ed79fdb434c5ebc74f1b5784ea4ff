Other women presidential candidates, particularly Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, disagreed. But when Sisulu described this ANC Women’s League decision as “undemocratic”, the league hit back in a statement in July: “Anyone who is aggrieved by decision of the democratically elected structures of the ANC or its leagues must use the organisational internal processes”. After Sisulu and National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete officially stepped up to the plate when the nominations window opened last month, Dlamini publicly said Dlamini Zuma was the ANC Women’s League’s only candidate.

Mkhize, like Ramaphosa, has been part of the party’s top six officials that have set the ANC’s direction in recent years – be that telling MPs not to vote in secret in the August secret ballot no confidence motion in President Jacob Zuma, or the decision that Zuma did not have to pay for Nkandla security upgrades, which the ANC implemented via a parliamentary ad hoc committee.

It’s something he’s deeply familiar with. As ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairperson since 2008, and premier since 2009, Mkhize kept the province on the same page. Following his move to Luthuli House after being elected treasurer at the December 2012 Mangaung ANC national conference, this unity unravelled. And it remains unravelled, following the recent court decision that the provincial ANC executive was unlawfully elected but with a recent ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) decision for a provincial task team including both sides yet to be implemented. By all accounts the visit by the top six to KwaZulu-Natal to resolve the matter may have led to frank discussions, but the appeal against the court judgment is still on, and the “unity” task team not established.

But its reach was felt already at the recent ANC policy conference, where Mpumalanga’s support for ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe’s scathing diagnostics report meant it was considered despite the objections by the Zuma supporting KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and the women’s, youth and veterans’ leagues.

But in the ANC, factional politicking that seems to come out against one faction may not necessarily indicate a definite change of heart. There are many factors involved, including grassroots sentiment and jockeying for posts. Perhaps this was a testing ground for the strength of Mabuza, said to be close to Zuma, and his province.

The prevailing popular take is that Dlamini Zuma is Jacob Zuma’s proxy and would ensure he’d not face trial on various charges. She also appears more comfortable in front of friendly audiences, but not so much when addressing one not constituted of ANC members. Speculation that she’s headed to Cabinet since her swearing in as ANC MP – she will serve on the small business development and arts and culture committees, according to the Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports (ATC), Parliament’s record of work – is another twist in the complex long-term game.

It was the UDM that approached the Constitutional Court for the right to have a secret ballot in the latest presidential no-confidence motion.
