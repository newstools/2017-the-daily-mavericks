Since he was promoted to his new position in March of 2017, his Twitter feed has resembled a feverish parody of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte’s more outrageous utterances.

That said, he doesn’t appear to have the requisite understanding of what policing entails: despite South Africans’ N.W.A.ish assertions regarding our girls and boys in blue, the SAPS comprises fellow citizens and human beings – 37 of them were killed on duty just in the first six months of 2017, with almost 600 of them attacked while on duty in the same period. They deserve a minister who doesn’t demand that they yell out “Let them piss and drink it” in unison at a Tactical Response Team rally.

We pay for corruption in many different ways, including through inflated prices our ministries and departments are charged for contracts secured through pay-to-play deals exactly like this one. The government suppliers aren’t fools – they know exactly where to make up the shortfall incurred by their largesse. They slap it onto the price tag.

But because of his entitled status, he is never bound by the law, and nor does he appear interested in upholding it – witness his complete inaction in regard to the #GuptaLeaks. In his mind, the criminals are the poor nobodies he parades on his Twitter account, guilty until proven innocent.
