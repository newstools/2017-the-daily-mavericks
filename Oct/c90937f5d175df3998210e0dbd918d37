And Scopa was also briefed on National Treasury’s review of all Eskom coal contracts, including those with the Gupta-linked Tegeta, and found the power utility had contravened its own procurement processes. However, because that investigation was subsequently withdrawn, those coal contracts remained listed on the OCPO contract reviews.

It was a bizarre two-hour interaction in Parliament’s finance committee that raised more questions that were answered. And not only over the claimed achievement of establishing an automated supplier database. The central tender database that publishes all government tenders and the central database of registered suppliers were established in 2015, some two years after the OCPO was established in 2013.

In the 2016/17 financial year there were an eyebrow-raising 793 applications for deviations, effectively requests to stray from procurement procedures by departments, SOEs and other state entities. Of those, 450 were approved and 198 given the go-ahead with conditions at a cost to government of R37.67-billion. Eskom topped the list with R31.3-billion in deviations, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with R1.2-billion, followed by Rural Development Department at R685.9-billion and South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) with R404.7-million.

In addition, another R42.2-billion came from the national purse due to expansions and variations of contracts signed after the procurement process, with Eskom again leading the pack with R33.3-billion, followed by the Health Department (R6.2-billion) and the Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA) at R868.7-million.

But Mathebula told MPs he didn’t know how the decisions on deviations were made. “During my first month in office, I can’t say what justifies requests for deviations and what is not justifiable,” he said, adding later: “I can’t say what constitutes approval… not approval. That’s why I’m suggestion the framework.” But Mathebula told MPs he didn’t know how the decisions on deviations were made. “During my first month in office, I can’t say what justifies requests for deviations and what is not justifiable,” he said, adding later: “I can’t say what constitutes approval… not approval.

Yes, there was a National Treasury instruction on how to deal with deviations, he said: “That’s the framework we have, but it’s something we need to strengthen… That framework is not detailed enough.

The National Treasury website contains information about the strategic procurement framework “to support a more strategic and efficient approach for procurement of goods and services. Under this framework, procuring goods and services now has an emphasis on complexity and risk with each procurement requiring forward planning”, according to one document.

And in announcing the resignation of the first ever chief procurement officer, Kenneth Brown, in December 2016, the National Treasury said, “The OCPO is now fully established with capability in policy and legislative formulation, governance monitoring and compliance, SCM (supply chain management) automation, centralised procurement; strategic procurement; and stakeholder management.” And in announcing the resignation of the first ever chief procurement officer, Kenneth Brown, in December 2016, the National Treasury said, “The OCPO is now fully established with capability in policy and legislative formulation, governance monitoring and compliance, SCM (supply chain management) automation, centralised procurement; strategic procurement; and stakeholder management.” And in announcing the resignation of the first ever chief procurement officer, Kenneth Brown, in December 2016, the National Treasury said, “The OCPO is now fully established with capability in policy and legislative formulation, governance monitoring and compliance, SCM (supply chain management) automation, centralised procurement; strategic procurement; and stakeholder management.”        While Mathebula on Wednesday talked of strengthening the office, the OCPO monitoring and compliance section appears to be doing its job. According to the Sunday Times, officials inspected various Eskom offices following a request for just over 9,000 chairs at a cost of around R2,600 each, or R24-million, in addition to the existing R72-million contract. Only about 500 chairs were actually needed. While Mathebula on Wednesday talked of strengthening the office, the OCPO monitoring and compliance section appears to be doing its job.

Those changes, including a review of the OCPO duties, were at the heart of Sunday’s City Press report. But this was dismissed as “completely inaccurate” by the acting chief procurement officer: “I have never met the minister, I have never met the deputy minister as an individual.
