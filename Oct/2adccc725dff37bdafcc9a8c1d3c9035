       Cape Town’s “new normal” sees water shut off to pre-selected suburbs during certain hours, the City of Cape Town announced this week. The measure, comparable to electricity load shedding, accompanies a reduction in water pressure and is part of Phase One of the City’s disaster plan.

What are the times in which the still-mysterious suburbs will not have water? One assumes that this information would be useful to citizens for planning purposes.

Since the axe could apparently fall on any suburb at any time, Limberg urges “all residents” to store “up to 5 litres of water for drinking and basic hygiene at all times”. Stockpiling municipal water, she reminded Daily Maverick, is illegal.

There is little doubt that the current water crisis is indeed complex, multifaceted and subject to many factors beyond the direct control of the City of Cape Town. Nonetheless, the sense that the public is being given vague and partial information is hard to shake.

The drastic nature of Phase 2 means that there is considerable public anxiety around this scenario – but again, no clear timelines can be provided. The City’s disaster plan states that its implementation will be considered “when there is a high likelihood that dam storage will drop below 10% before the onset of the winter rains”.

Limberg says the timeline “primarily depend[s] on water consumption and how quickly all water users in Cape Town respond to the call to drastically reduce consumption to the required levels”. This heavy reliance on Capetonians reducing water usage is also causing some scepticism, however, given that the city is still using more than 100-million litres per day more than the target – and that is before the seasonal influx of millions of visitors over summer. The City believes that the extra water-consuming bodies in Cape Town over this period will be balanced out by locals going elsewhere and industry coming to a halt over the festive season.
