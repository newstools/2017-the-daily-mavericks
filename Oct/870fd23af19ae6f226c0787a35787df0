But it wasn’t a birthday or graduation: the Khayelitsha teenager had taken the last of her TB medication.         Kuse was diagnosed with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) just before Christmas when she was just 16. Her grandmother had lost all hope, she says. She thought Kuse was going to die.  Kuse was diagnosed with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) just before Christmas when she was just 16. Her grandmother had lost all hope, she says. She thought Kuse was going to die.         It was already a difficult time. “I lost my aunt in December, the one I was living with because my mother died when I was still a baby,” says Kuse. “The day my aunt was laid to rest, I started getting sick. I did not have an appetite. My skin colour was pale and I was shaking, sweating a lot at night. I did not enjoy all the things I used to do.” She was given treatment but became sicker. She bled, vomited and became dizzy. She suffered a skin reaction. Upon returning home from the Eastern Cape after the festive season, she suffered another blow. She did not just have MDR-TB. She had extensively-drug-resistant TB – XDR-TB, which was far more serious.

She had extensively-drug-resistant TB – XDR-TB, which was far more serious.         XDR-TB spreads the same way as all TB, but it is a relatively rare form of MDR-TB. It is resistant to almost all drugs, including two of the best first-line treatments: isoniazid and rifampin. It typically does not respond to second-line treatments either, such as fluoroquinolones, amikacin or kanamycin. According to the World Health Organisation, it generally requires treatments that are more expensive and the prognosis is generally worse. The availability of drugs, as well as early detection, play a major role.  XDR-TB spreads the same way as all TB, but it is a relatively rare form of MDR-TB.

She is one of the patients treated on Medicins Sans Frontieres’ TB programme in Khayelitsha, one of the few sites in South Africa where delaminid and bedaquiline, which are used to treat MDR-TB, are available. Her doctor referred her to a counsellor who offered her the option of delaminid. He also warned her about the side effects, which included possible damage to the heart.  Kuse was fortunate.

The side effects of delaminid have been a point of extensive discussion and study. Most common, affecting up to a third of patients, are nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Anxiety, tingling and shaking can also occur. The more serious side effect is known as QT prolongation, a change in the heart’s electrical activity that can potentially cause life-threatening changes in the heart rhythm.

Nonetheless, a 2015 study emphasised its effectiveness in treating TB, with led study investigator Dr Andra Cirule to argue for its benefits. “XDR-TB is one of the deadliest and most difficult forms of TB to treat. More new medicines are urgently needed to prevent XDR-TB from becoming a death sentence. If confirmed, the analysis shows that delamanid may be an effective option to improve the current standard of care,” Cirule said.

Other researchers have argued that the newest drugs may in fact have fewer side effects than older treatments. The Centre for Disease Research and Policy cites studies on both delanimid and bedaquiline, pointing out that older drugs also have severe side effects but are less effective. Many existing TB treatments are “limited, expensive, and often toxic, and the drug regimens can last for up to two years,” they argue.

What of bedaquiline? MSF says almost three quarters (74%) of its patients receiving a combination of the two drugs for six months achieved “culture conversion”, an early indicator that treatment might ultimately be successful. The data is anecdotal, but MSF is cautiously optimistic. What of bedaquiline?

The WHO endorses delamanid to replace the injectable agent for children and adolescents with DR-TB in cases of intolerance or resistance to some drugs, giving this group an option more effective and less toxic than standard treatment,” says Dr Anja Reuter. “As MSF, we attempt to offer delamanid as a primary option for children and adolescents with DR-TB whenever feasible, to avoid the risk of side effects from the injectable drugs.

This is in part because the eligibility criteria currently exclude people with XDR-TB, and patients on bedaquiline. South Africa’s Medicines Control Council (MCC) is reviewing a revised protocol that would expand DCAP eligibility to these groups, as well as a dossier to fully register delamanid in South Africa.  This is in part because the eligibility criteria currently exclude people with XDR-TB, and patients on bedaquiline.

The Bedaquiline Clinical Access Programme started with just over 200 patients in two years, but in the two years since registration and introduction into national guidelines, South Africa has initiated over 6,700 patients on bedaquiline.

Stone points out that TB killed 1.8-million people in 2016, or 4,900 people every day. And, she adds, while side-effects are a concern, a far greater worry is availability. Bedaquiline, she points out, has reached just 1,000 people despite being approved in 2012. Stone lays the blame largely at the feet of pharmaceutical companies. US President Donald Trump’s approach to healthcare funding will not help, she adds.   contributor Judy Stone argues that progress in eradicating TB will continue to suffer from budget constraints, especially in poorer countries, unless pharma and governments “step up more”.
