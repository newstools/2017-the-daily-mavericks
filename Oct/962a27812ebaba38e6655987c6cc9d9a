       In Marikana informal settlement on the Cape Flats, 18 people were murdered and four wounded in 17 days in September. Police from the local station, Philippi East, appeared to sit on their hands until the killing of 11 people last Friday hit the headlines. Now the area is flooded with additional police deployed there until April 2018, as Police Minister Fikile Mbalula on Tuesday made a turn there talking “flashlights” and announcing that there would be a new station commissioner.

But this display of action is just that: a show. It’s a Band-Aid that cannot hide the deep-seated dereliction of duty by police in their constitutional responsibility to “prevent, combat and investigate crime, maintain public order, to protect and secure the inhabitants of the Republic and to uphold and enforce the law”.

Between May and September 2017, the SAPS held 11 special operations in Marikana, leading to 294 arrests. Amid long-standing community complaints about lack of action by police to their complaints, Jula chose to highlight as a “breakthrough” the arrests made for business robberies and the confiscation of 18 illegal firearms. Little was said about the SAPS’s failure to close down the 153 identified illegal liquor outlets in the area – and seven drug dens – beyond a shrug-of-the-shoulders response by Mothiba: “It’s a way of life. It’s a way of survival.” Between May and September 2017, the SAPS held 11 special operations in Marikana, leading to 294 arrests.

Residents got together to patrol the streets the SAPS were too scared or disinterested to safeguard. There have been long-standing grievances about the police’s failure to respond to complaints – the SAPS top brass acknowledged to MPs this week that only about 60% of station commissioners were up to the task – amid a complex set of dynamics of vigilantism, gangsterism and criminality, central to which are “amawele” (isiXhosa for twins), one of whom was in jail. This was eventually sort of confirmed by police on Tuesday – “We are becoming aware who the (criminal) leaders are,” said Mothiba – after it was first raised in a Marikana community leader’s account of what was happening on Monday’s SAfm the forum @ Eight debate.

But these dynamics seemed beyond the SAPS on Tuesday amid an admission by crime intelligence that it was caught with its pants down due to lack of impimpis.

On 25 September one person was forcibly taken form a house and found stabbed to death, while a day later two people died in another incident that also left a third person critically injured in hospital. On 27 September two people were found dead, with another found with multiple stab wounds.

This dry bureaucratic police jargon obscures the horror of a community under the whip of criminals and gangsters in Cape Town’s Marikana. Similar accounts emerged at the Moerane commission of inquiry that heard of “room lords” running the notorious Glebelands hostel. And it echoes across South Africa.
