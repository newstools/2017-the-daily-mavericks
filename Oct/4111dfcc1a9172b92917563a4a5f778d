The Democratic Alliance, as leader Mmusi Maimane reminded delegates at the party’s Western Cape provincial congress last weekend, has made one central promise to voters in every election.        This promise is that the DA offers the people of South Africa a complete change from the disaster of the ANC government,” Maimane said. “Not an incremental change. Not better in certain aspects of governing. Not a bit more responsive or a bit less corrupt. Complete change.” This promise is that the DA offers the people of South Africa a complete change from the disaster of the ANC government,” Maimane said. “Not an incremental change.

To take one example: the allegations which surfaced over the past week regarding upgrades to Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille’s private residence. This is a story which has been leapt on with alacrity by the opposition ANC in the Western Cape, but it’s worth bearing in mind that the original messenger for the rumours came from within DA ranks, in the form of councillor and De Lille nemesis JP Smith.

So who paid: De Lille, or the City of Cape Town?    1  1   1 The ANC in the Western Cape seized on De Lille’s statement that she had personally footed the bill and termed it an outright lie, with councillor Xolani Sontashe providing journalists with an invoice which indicated that security gates had been installed at De Lille’s house at a cost of R140,139.98 and billed to the City of Cape Town. The ANC suggested the total cost of security upgrades may have been R700,000.

There are two points to be extracted from this unedifying situation. There are two points to be extracted from this unedifying situation.        The first is that it is entirely possible that nothing untoward has occurred at De Lille’s house, since politicians are entitled to security measures. The source of the conflict between the City’s explanations and De Lille’s explanation may be that there were two forms of work undertaken on her residence: general renovations, for which the mayor paid personally, and publicly funded security upgrades. De Lille was possibly referring to the former in her statement, and the City to the latter.

The DA cannot be blamed for poor rain in the Western Cape, but amid reports that the City of Cape Town has been aware of the impending water crisis for some years, there is every indication that the situation has been badly mishandled. In its pursuit of development at all costs, a DA provincial government may find itself unable to provide citizens with the most basic of all resources: water. The social and political fallout from such a scenario would be disastrous.
