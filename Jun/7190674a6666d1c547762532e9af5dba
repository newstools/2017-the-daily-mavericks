It was a bruising off-script meander, but one taken with astute political acumen. By criticising the veterans for going outside ANC structures, and sharing information that apparently many did no actually agree with what had been put out publicly, Zuma took charge. Describing the veterans as they call themselves stalwarts , he effectively used his political overview to hit back, including at former president Thabo Mbeki of course, not named for his open letter. They think branches are just riff raff They think they have power over everything, said Zuma, following up on his earlier tribute to branches as the heart and soul of the ANC when he also traversed into leadership elections. ANC branches must use their power to elect their leaders, said Zuma, because no-one but the conference of branches could do so: You are the only ones who can hire and fire . In the scripted speech, Zuma simply reminded all that leaders must be assessed and democratically elected in line with ANC policies. While veterans wanting to determine the platform to discuss the troubled state of the ANC was funny , according to Zuma, so were opposition parties which failed to understand democracy is determined by the majority. But then making a blunt statement on this hot topic in the public discourse would have been just too obvious. And that is out of line with Zuma s style. DM DM th
