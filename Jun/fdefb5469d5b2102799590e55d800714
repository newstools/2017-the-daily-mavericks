In the last few years alone, food prices in Kenya have sky rocketed. The price of sugar has doubled, from KES200 to KES400. Milk has more than doubled, from a mere KES30 to KES72, in some places tripling to a whopping KES90. Maize has risen from an average of KES78 to KES150.

The drought has severely impacted the ability of the country to produce enough electricity. As a result, the country s power utility has had to import from neighbouring Uganda. It has always done so, but the drought has driven a rise in imports by over 300% in 4 months. Its own production has fallen from 1.25 billion units, to just 910 million units in the same period. Imports from Ethiopia have also risen, from 740,000 units to 870,000 units. As a result, the country s power utility has had to import from neighbouring Uganda.

The President s close allies are corrupt to say the very least. Just this May, the United States government suspended $21-million in aid funding to the Ministry of Health over allegations of corruption. On the other hand, the political crisis is deepening.

In 2015, the auditor general, revealed that only 1% of Kenya s finances were properly audited, while the finance Minister stated that $6-billion was lost to corruption per year. That is 10% of the country s entire GDP, and one and half times the size of Zimbabwe s entire budget.

For that reason alone, Kenya seems headed for a full-blown recession at best, at worst, a total collapse of state. Uhuru Kenyatta s government has done a poor job of running the country.

Human rights are under immense attack every day. Since 2013, at least two journalists have been killed. The motivations were clearly political. The government has gone rogue in some senses too.

It is extremely dangerous to be a political journalist in Kenya right now. And if a government can do these things to its story tellers, who have access to the international community and the world, what more can they do to ordinary Kenyans, whose only window to the world is a smartphone imported from Dubai?

At least 45 people have disappeared in Kenya or found dead after counter-terrorism operations. Police vans have been turned into mobile torture chambers, and several innocent Kenyans have been abducted, tortured, and killed in the name of policing. Several other Kenyans are now simply afraid.

Most Kenyans are starting to feel the pinch of such profligacy. The drought may be outside the control of the government, but its response to it has been corrupt. Choosing instead to loot whatever aid has come in, or distribute it along partisan lines, while milking all other sectors of government dry.

With elections scheduled for August, it would rank an opportune time for change. A chance for Kenyans to overhaul a government that has taken them from the foot of the river Jordan, all the way to the gates of hunger and chaos.

Speaking to locals in the streets of Nairobi, listening to them narrate their new ordeals, their challenges with hunger, access to food, water, sanitation, services, and hearing their incensed lamentations about the brazen misgovernance, one would assume that the August elections would give them a chance to kick Kenyatta out.

Kenyatta is not a good President, but he is Kikuyu. I am Kikuyu. I have to vote for him.

They highlight a critical dimension of Kenyan politics. In Kenya, tribalism plays a huge role in politics. The Kikuyu s, from whom Kenyatta emanates from, are notorious for voting as a bloc. While they identify the obvious blatant weaknesses of Kenyatta, and even highlight themselves the amount of damage another Kenyatta re-election would bring, they still pledge loyalty to him, on tribal grounds.

While they identify the obvious blatant weaknesses of Kenyatta, and even highlight themselves the amount of damage another Kenyatta re-election would bring, they still pledge loyalty to him, on tribal grounds. They have all the reason to. The country s first president, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, was Kikuyu. On accession to power, he rewarded most of the Kikuyu s with land, access to opportunities, and education. He built a very large patronage system, which has seen Kikuyu people rise to become the wealthiest in the entire nation. They have all the reason to.
