Although the 5m-wide stream that forms the headwaters of Mabola is by no means comparable in size to the Zambezi, the river and its high water-yield catchment area have generated as much controversy as the Victoria Falls has earned itself fame.

The importance of Mabola is that it is the source of three major rivers the Pongola, Tugela and Vaal which support huge communities and economic activities downstream. Enkangala supplies water to South Africa s economic hub, Gauteng, and is an important source for the agricultural sector in the KwaZulu-Natal and Free State provinces.
